  "description": "Under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023, every organization or government body that decides how and why personal data is processed is called a Data Fiduciary. The Act places clear responsibilities on Data Fiduciaries to ensure that they handle data lawfully, fairly, and with respect for individualsâ€™ privacy. These duties are not optional; they are legal requirements that apply to all entities handling personal data.",
