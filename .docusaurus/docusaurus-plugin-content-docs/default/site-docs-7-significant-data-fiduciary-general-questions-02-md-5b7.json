  "description": "The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA) does not provide a direct mechanism within Section 10 itself for challenging the Central Government’s decision to classify an entity as a Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF). However, the Act provides a general right of appeal under Chapter VII (Sections 29–30) that can be used to challenge orders or directions made by authorities under the Act, including those issued by or under the authority of the Central Government or the Data Protection Board of India.",
