  "description": "The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 gives every individual, known as the Data Principal, a set of rights over their personal data. These rights ensure that people are not left powerless once their information is collected by a company, government body, or any other organization. Instead, they have the ability to control how their data is used, corrected, and even deleted.",
