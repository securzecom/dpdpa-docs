This legislation, accompanied by the Draft Rules released in January 2025, establishes a structured regime for how organizations, governments, and intermediaries collect, process, store, and share personal data. Its enactment is a direct response to the exponential growth of India’s digital economy and the increasing volume of personal information being processed on digital platforms. By codifying the responsibilities of organizations and the rights of individuals, DPDPA provides a legal foundation to ensure that privacy is not merely aspirational but enforceable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA":{"id":"Overview/Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA","title":"Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA","description":"One of the most debated questions in data protection is: Can personal data leave the country? The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 addresses this directly. India has chosen a balanced path — allowing cross-border transfers but retaining the power to restrict them when necessary.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Duties and Obligations of Data Fiduciaries":{"id":"Overview/Duties and Obligations of Data Fiduciaries","title":"Duties and Obligations of Data Fiduciaries","description":"Under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023, every organization or government body that decides how and why personal data is processed is called a Data Fiduciary. The Act places clear responsibilities on Data Fiduciaries to ensure that they handle data lawfully, fairly, and with respect for individuals’ privacy. These duties are not optional; they are legal requirements that apply to all entities handling personal data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/intro":{"id":"Overview/intro","title":"intro","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Key Definitions under DPDPA":{"id":"Overview/Key Definitions under DPDPA","title":"Key Definitions under DPDPA","description":"To understand the framework of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023, it is essential to become familiar with its core definitions. These terms are consistently used throughout the Act and the Draft Rules of 2025, and they form the foundation for interpreting rights, duties, and obligations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Penalties and Enforcement under the DPDPA":{"id":"Overview/Penalties and Enforcement under the DPDPA","title":"Penalties and Enforcement under the DPDPA","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 is not just a statement of rights and duties; it is a binding law with real consequences for non-compliance. To ensure that organizations treat personal data with seriousness, the Act empowers the Data Protection Board of India to enforce compliance and impose penalties when violations occur.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Rights of Data Principals":{"id":"Overview/Rights of Data Principals","title":"Rights of Data Principals","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 gives every individual, known as the Data Principal, a set of rights over their personal data. These rights ensure that people are not left powerless once their information is collected by a company, government body, or any other organization. Instead, they have the ability to control how their data is used, corrected, and even deleted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Role of Consent Managers":{"id":"Overview/Role of Consent Managers","title":"Role of Consent Managers","description":"One of the most innovative features of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 is the introduction of Consent Managers. These are independent, registered entities whose sole purpose is to help individuals exercise control over their personal data. Unlike traditional systems where each company manages consent separately, Consent Managers act as a neutral platform that allows people to view, grant, and withdraw consent across multiple services in one place.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Scope & Applicability of DPDPA":{"id":"Overview/Scope & Applicability of DPDPA","title":"Scope & Applicability of DPDPA","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023, along with its Draft Rules of 2025, establishes a framework that applies broadly across entities and sectors in India. Its scope is deliberately wide to ensure that any processing of personal data affecting individuals within India is governed by uniform standards of accountability, transparency, and security.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Security Safeguards and Breach Notification":{"id":"Overview/Security Safeguards and Breach Notification","title":"Security Safeguards and Breach Notification","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 requires every organization, whether small or large, to protect the personal data it collects with strong technical and organizational safeguards. Security is not treated as an afterthought; it is the backbone of compliance. Organizations are expected to anticipate risks, prevent misuse, and respond immediately when things go wrong.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Special Duties of Significant Data Fiduciaries":{"id":"Overview/Special Duties of Significant Data Fiduciaries","title":"Special Duties of Significant Data Fiduciaries","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 recognizes that certain organizations handle much larger volumes of personal data or process data that is highly sensitive. Because misuse or mishandling of such data can have severe consequences for individuals and even for national security, the government can classify such entities as Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs). Banks, healthcare providers, social media platforms, telecom companies, and large technology firms are examples of organizations that are likely to fall under this category.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/The Data Protection Board of India":{"id":"Overview/The Data Protection Board of India","title":"The Data Protection Board of India","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 establishes the Data Protection Board of India as the central regulatory authority responsible for monitoring compliance, handling grievances, and ensuring enforcement of the law. The creation of the Board is a cornerstone of the Act because without an independent authority, the rights of individuals and the obligations of organizations would remain largely theoretical.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}
