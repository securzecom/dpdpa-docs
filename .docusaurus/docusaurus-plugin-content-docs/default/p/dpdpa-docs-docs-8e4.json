This legislation, accompanied by the Draft Rules released in January 2025, establishes a structured regime for how organizations, governments, and intermediaries collect, process, store, and share personal data. Its enactment is a direct response to the exponential growth of India’s digital economy and the increasing volume of personal information being processed on digital platforms. By codifying the responsibilities of organizations and the rights of individuals, DPDPA provides a legal foundation to ensure that privacy is not merely aspirational but enforceable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA":{"id":"Overview/Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA","title":"Cross-Border Data Transfers under DPDPA","description":"One of the most debated questions in data protection is: Can personal data leave the country?

Because misuse or mishandling of such data can have severe consequences for individuals and even for national security, the government can classify such entities as Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs). Banks, healthcare providers, social media platforms, telecom companies, and large technology firms are examples of organizations that are likely to fall under this category.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Overview/The Data Protection Board of India":{"id":"Overview/The Data Protection Board of India","title":"The Data Protection Board of India","description":"The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 establishes the Data Protection Board of India as the central regulatory authority responsible for monitoring compliance, handling grievances, and ensuring enforcement of the law.
