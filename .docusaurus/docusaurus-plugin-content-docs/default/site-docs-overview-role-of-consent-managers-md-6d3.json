  "description": "One of the most innovative features of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 is the introduction of Consent Managers. These are independent, registered entities whose sole purpose is to help individuals exercise control over their personal data. Unlike traditional systems where each company manages consent separately, Consent Managers act as a neutral platform that allows people to view, grant, and withdraw consent across multiple services in one place.",
