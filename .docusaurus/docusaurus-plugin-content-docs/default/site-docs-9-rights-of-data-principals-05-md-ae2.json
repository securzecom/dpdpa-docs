  "description": "The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA) requires companies (called Data Fiduciaries) to respond to all lawful requests made by Data Principals — such as requests for access, correction, erasure, or withdrawal of consent — “as soon as may be practicable.” While the Act does not specify an exact number of days, this phrase establishes a legal duty of promptness and reasonableness, meaning companies must act without undue delay and in good faith.",
