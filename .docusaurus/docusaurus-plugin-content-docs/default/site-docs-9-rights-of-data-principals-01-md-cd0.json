  "description": "Under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), every Data Principal (the individual whose data is being processed) has a legal right to request correction, completion, updating, or erasure of their personal data. If a company — also known as a Data Fiduciary — ignores, delays, or refuses such a request without valid justification, it is considered a breach of its statutory obligation under Section 12 and may face investigation and monetary penalties imposed by the Data Protection Board of India.",
