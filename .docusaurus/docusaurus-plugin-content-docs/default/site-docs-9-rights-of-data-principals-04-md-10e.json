  "description": "Under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), a company (Data Fiduciary) must normally correct, update, or erase personal data upon a valid request from a Data Principal. However, it may lawfully refuse such a request if the continued retention or processing of that data is necessary to comply with any law in force — a concept referred to as “legal necessity.”",
