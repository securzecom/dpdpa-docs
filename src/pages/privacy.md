This website (dpdpaedu.org) is a community-driven initiative managed by **Navneetpriya Softech Solutions LLP (Securze)**.  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how this website functions.

We do **not** collect personal data, do **not** store cookies, and do **not** use any forms to capture user information.

## 1. No Cookies Used

This website does **not** set or store any cookies on your device.

- No session cookies  
- No tracking cookies

- No identifiers of any kind  

Your visit to this site remains free from cookie-based tracking.

## 2. Analytics (Anonymous)

We use **Microsoft Clarity** for basic analytics to understand how users interact with the website and to improve the quality of the content.

Clarity collects minimal, anonymized interaction data such as:

- Page views  
- Scroll and click patterns  
- Device/browser type  
- Anonymous usage heatmaps  

All analytics operate **only after you provide consent**.  
Clarity does **not** collect names, email addresses, form data, or any personally identifying information through this site.

### Revoke Analytics Consent

If you previously consented to analytics and wish to revoke it, click the button below:

<button
  className="button button--primary"
  style={{
    marginTop: '12px',
    backgroundColor: '#2E7D32',
  }}
  onClick={() => {
    localStorage.removeItem('cookie-consent');
    location.reload();
  }}
>
  Revoke Consent
</button>

## 3. Visit Counter (Non-Personal)

The website displays a simple **visitor counter** that increases with each page load.

- It is powered by an external “hit counter” service.
- It **does not** collect or store personal data.
- It does **not** track individual users or identifiers.
- It only increments a **global visit number**, not unique visitors.

This counter functions independently from analytics and does not identify you in any way.

This site does **not** contain:

- Contact forms  
- Subscription forms  
- Input fields  
- Login or registration modules  

We do **not** ask for or collect:

- Names  
- Email addresses  
- Phone numbers

- Uploaded content  

You can browse the entire guide freely without sharing any information.
