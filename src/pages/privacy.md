## 2. Analytics (Anonymous)

We use **Microsoft Clarity** for basic analytics to understand how users interact with the website and to improve the quality of the content.

Clarity collects minimal, anonymized interaction data such as:

- Page views  
- Scroll and click patterns  
- Device/browser type  
- Anonymous usage heatmaps  

All analytics operate **only after you provide consent**.  
Clarity does **not** collect names, email addresses, form data, or any personally identifying information through this site.

### Revoke Analytics Consent

If you previously consented to analytics and wish to revoke it, click the button below:

<button
  className="button button--primary"
  style={{
    marginTop: '12px',
    backgroundColor: '#2E7D32',
  }}
  onClick={() => {
    localStorage.removeItem('cookie-consent');
    location.reload();
  }}

## 3. Visit Counter (Non-Personal)

The website displays a simple **visitor counter** that increases with each page load.

- It is powered by an external “hit counter” service.
- It **does not** collect or store personal data.
- It does **not** track individual users or identifiers.
- It only increments a **global visit number**, not unique visitors.

This counter functions independently from analytics and does not identify you in any way.
