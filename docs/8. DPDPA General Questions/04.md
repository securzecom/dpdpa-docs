# Q4 - How does DPDPA interact with existing Indian laws (IT Act, RBI, IRDAI, SEBI, etc.)?

:::tip Answer
DPDPA is a horizontal law — it applies to all sectors, while sector regulators continue to enforce vertical laws.  

- **IT Act, 2000**: Covers cybercrime and certain security practices. DPDPA specifically governs privacy and data protection, and both will coexist.  
- **RBI Regulations**: Banks must already follow RBI’s cybersecurity and customer protection rules. DPDPA adds individual rights (access, correction, erasure) on top of those obligations.  
- **IRDAI (insurance), SEBI (securities), TRAI (telecom)**: These regulators already prescribe sector-specific compliance. DPDPA is an umbrella layer ensuring that across all sectors, privacy rights are uniformly protected.  

:::info Example
If an insurance company mishandles health data:  
- IRDAI may act for violating insurance regulations.  
- The Data Protection Board may impose penalties under DPDPA for violating privacy rights.  

Companies must comply with both sectoral rules and DPDPA, not one or the other.
