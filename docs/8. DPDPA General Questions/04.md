# Q4 - How does DPDPA interact with existing Indian laws (IT Act, RBI, IRDAI, SEBI, etc.)?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* does **not replace** India’s existing legal and regulatory frameworks — instead, it is designed to **complement and coexist** with them. The DPDPA serves as an **umbrella data protection law** that applies across all sectors, while **sectoral regulators** such as the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**, **Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)**, and **Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)** continue to enforce **industry-specific rules** related to security, privacy, and information governance.

## Comparison: DPDPA vs IT Act vs RBI vs IRDAI vs SEBI

| **Aspect** | **DPDPA, 2023** | **Information Technology Act, 2000** | **RBI Regulations** | **IRDAI Guidelines** | **SEBI Cybersecurity Framework** |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Personal data protection, consent, rights of individuals | Cybercrime, digital signatures, unauthorized access, data protection (limited) | Financial data security, payment data localization, IT governance | Confidentiality of policyholder data, IT & outsourcing oversight | Protection of investor data, system security, incident response |
| **Scope of Coverage** | All organizations processing personal data (public and private) | All entities handling computer resources or digital systems | Banks, NBFCs, payment companies, FinTechs | Insurance companies, brokers, TPAs, reinsurers | Stock brokers, exchanges, depositories, mutual funds |

| **Core Obligations** | Lawful processing, purpose limitation, consent, user rights, data breach reporting | Implement security practices, protect data from unauthorized access, report cyber incidents | Secure storage and processing of customer data, payment data localization, cyber audit reporting | Obtain explicit consent, secure outsourcing, incident management | Ensure investor data protection, incident reporting, annual cybersecurity audits |
| **Rights of Individuals** | Yes — right to access, correction, erasure, grievance redressal | Limited — not explicitly defined | No explicit individual rights (focused on institutional compliance) | Implicit consent rights for policyholders | Limited — focused on investor protection via intermediaries |
| **Consent Requirements** | Explicit, verifiable, purpose-specific consent required for processing | Not detailed (pre-DPDPA) | Customer consent for KYC and data sharing (as per RBI directions) | Written consent for sharing policyholder data | Disclosure-based consent in investor onboarding |
| **Breach Notification** | Mandatory to the Data Protection Board and affected individuals | Mandatory to CERT-In | Mandatory to RBI within defined timelines | Mandatory to IRDAI within 24 hours | Mandatory to SEBI immediately after detection |
| **Data Localization** | Permitted unless restricted by Government order | Not mandated | Mandatory for payment data (RBI 2018 Circular) | Encouraged for sensitive insurance data | Recommended for trading and KYC data |
| **Penalties** | Up to ₹250 crore depending on nature of breach | Compensation-based; lower financial penalties | Regulatory penalties, monetary fines, or license actions | Penalties under IRDAI Act and IT Act | Penalties, license suspension, or enforcement actions |
| **Cross-Border Data Transfers** | Allowed subject to conditions notified by Government | No specific regulation | Restricted for payment data | Allowed with safeguards and consent | Allowed under SEBI oversight and market data rules |
| **Sector-Specific Application** | All sectors (horizontal law) | All sectors (cyber law focus) | Financial sector (vertical law) | Insurance sector (vertical law) | Securities & capital markets (vertical law) |
| **Overlap With DPDPA** | — | Cyber incident reporting, security standards | Consent, retention, data protection obligations | Consent, data sharing, retention | Security and data breach reporting |
| **Conflict Resolution** | DPDPA prevails where higher data protection is provided | Harmonized through government notification | Must comply with both frameworks | Must comply with both frameworks | Must comply with both frameworks |


---

### **1. Relationship with the Information Technology Act, 2000**

The DPDPA is meant to **supersede overlapping provisions** of the IT Act concerning data protection and privacy, while retaining the IT Act’s role in areas such as cybercrimes and digital contracts.

- **Sections 43A and 72A** of the IT Act — which previously governed compensation and penalties for data breaches — will eventually become **redundant** once the DPDPA is fully enforced.  
- However, **cybercrime offences**, **hacking**, **unauthorized access**, and **digital evidence** provisions under the IT Act continue to apply.  
- The DPDPA focuses on **lawful processing, consent, and data rights**, while the IT Act remains focused on **security and criminal enforcement**.

:::info Example
If a company’s database is hacked,  
- The **IT Act** applies to prosecute the hacker and manage cybercrime reporting.  
- The **DPDPA** applies to ensure the company had appropriate safeguards and consent mechanisms in place before the breach occurred.
:::

### **2. Relationship with RBI Regulations (Banking & FinTech)**

The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** already enforces **stringent data security and localization norms**, particularly for:
- Payment data (as per RBI’s 2018 circular on data storage).  
- Customer privacy and confidentiality (as per the Banking Regulation Act and Master Directions).

The DPDPA adds another layer of accountability:
- Banks and FinTechs must now ensure **lawful processing and consent** in addition to data security.  
- RBI’s data localization mandates remain valid — the DPDPA does not override them.  
- Non-compliance with either framework can result in penalties under **both** DPDPA and RBI regulations.

:::tip
The DPDPA governs **how** personal data is collected, shared, and erased.  
RBI governs **where** financial data is stored and **how** it must be secured.
:::

### **3. Relationship with IRDAI Regulations (Insurance Sector)**

The **Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)** mandates insurers to:
- Maintain confidentiality of policyholder information.  
- Obtain explicit consent before sharing data with third parties.  
- Follow strict outsourcing and IT security guidelines.

The DPDPA reinforces these duties:
- Consent and grievance-handling requirements under DPDPA now apply **in addition** to IRDAI’s circulars.  
- Insurers must ensure their **Consent Managers** and **third-party processors** comply with both DPDPA and IRDAI guidelines.

:::info Example
An insurance company sharing customer data with a health analytics firm must comply with  
➡️ **IRDAI’s outsourcing norms**, and  
➡️ **DPDPA’s consent and purpose limitation rules.**
:::

### **4. Relationship with SEBI Regulations (Securities & Capital Markets)**

The **Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)** mandates regulated entities such as brokers, depositories, and exchanges to:
- Maintain IT and cyber resilience frameworks.  
- Ensure investor data confidentiality.  
- Report cybersecurity incidents promptly.

The DPDPA complements SEBI’s framework by:
- Adding individual **rights of Data Principals** (investors, clients).  
- Requiring **lawful consent** for personal data usage.  
- Extending obligations for **breach notification** to the **Data Protection Board of India** in addition to SEBI.

---

### **5. Coexistence and Non-Derogation Clause**

Under **Section 29(4)** and related interpretative principles of the DPDPA:
- The Act operates **in addition to**, not **in substitution of**, other sectoral laws.  
- Where two laws conflict, the rule providing **higher protection to personal data** will prevail.  
- The Central Government may issue **harmonization guidelines** to resolve overlaps between DPDPA and sectoral regulations.

---

### **6. Unified Oversight in Practice**

| Area | Primary Regulator | DPDPA Role | Complementary Regulation |
|------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Cybersecurity & breaches | CERT-In / MeitY | Mandates breach notification to Data Protection Board | IT Act, CERT-In Directions (2022) |
| Banking & FinTech | RBI | Consent, retention, lawful use | RBI Master Directions, Payment Data Circular |
| Insurance | IRDAI | Consent, purpose limitation | IRDAI IT & Outsourcing Guidelines |
| Securities & Investments | SEBI | Lawful processing, grievance | SEBI Cybersecurity Framework |
| Data Protection & Privacy | Data Protection Board of India | Core privacy and rights enforcement | Applies to all sectors |

---

:::warning
Compliance with RBI, SEBI, or IRDAI frameworks **does not automatically ensure DPDPA compliance.**  
Organizations must **map and align** both regulatory obligations — particularly around consent management, retention, and breach reporting.
