# Q3 - Do small businesses and start-ups also need to comply, or only big companies?

:::tip Answer
Yes, all organizations that process personal data must comply â€” whether they are large corporations or small start-ups. However, compliance is proportionate to the scale and risk:  

- Small retailers collecting only customer names and phone numbers will have simpler compliance requirements.  
- A large fintech company handling Aadhaar, PAN, and financial transactions will face stricter obligations, and may even be classified as a Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF).  

:::info Example
- A local bakery using a phone number list for delivery updates must provide customers a way to opt out.  
- A crypto exchange handling millions in transactions must implement advanced safeguards, audits, and breach reporting systems.
