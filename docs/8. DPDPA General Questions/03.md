# Q3 - Do small businesses and start-ups also need to comply, or only big companies?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* applies **to all organizations** — large corporations, small businesses, and start-ups — that **process personal data** within India or offer goods and services to individuals in India.  

However, the Act gives the **Central Government** the power to **exempt certain small businesses and start-ups** from some of its more stringent provisions to avoid creating unnecessary compliance burdens.

### **1. General Rule — Applicability to All**
Every entity that collects, stores, or processes personal data of individuals (called **Data Principals**) is considered a **Data Fiduciary** under the DPDPA. This includes:
- Small enterprises and start-ups;  
- NGOs and educational institutions;  
- Multinational and large organizations.

So, even a small firm processing limited customer or employee data must follow **core obligations** such as lawful processing, security safeguards, and grievance handling.

### **2. Possible Exemptions for Start-ups and MSMEs**

Under **Section 17(3)** of the DPDPA:
> “The Central Government may, having regard to the volume and nature of personal data processed, notify certain Data Fiduciaries or class of Data Fiduciaries, **including start-ups**, as Data Fiduciaries to whom the provisions of Section 5, sub-sections (3) and (7) of Section 8, and Sections 10 and 11 shall not apply.”

This means the Government can officially **relax some obligations** (like publishing detailed notices, performing audits, or appointing a Data Protection Officer) for smaller firms whose operations pose **minimal privacy risks**.

---

### **3. Definition of “Start-up”**
The same section clarifies that:
> A “start-up” means a private limited company, partnership firm, or LLP incorporated in India, **recognized as a start-up** by the department handling start-up affairs in the Central Government (currently, the **Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade – DPIIT**).

---

### **4. What Small Entities Still Must Do**

Even if exempted from advanced requirements, small businesses must still:
- Obtain **valid and informed consent** before processing personal data.  
- Protect data through **reasonable security safeguards**.  
- Report data breaches to the **Data Protection Board of India**.  
- **Erase data** once the purpose of collection is fulfilled or consent withdrawn.

---

:::tip Key Insight
Every organization that processes personal data falls within the DPDPA’s scope, but **the level of compliance is proportional to the scale and sensitivity** of data processing. Start-ups and small businesses may receive official **relaxations** from some complex duties — but not from **core principles of privacy and security**.
