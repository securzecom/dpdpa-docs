# Q1 - Can the Board initiate an investigation on its own, or only based on complaints?
:::tip Answer
- Yes, the Board can act suo motu (on its own initiative).  
- Apart from individual complaints, the Board may investigate if it learns of a breach or violation from media reports, whistleblowers, or breach notifications.  
- This makes enforcement proactive, not just reactive.  
:::

:::info Example
- If news breaks that XYZ E-commerce leaked millions of customer addresses online, the Board does not need to wait for complaints. It can start an inquiry directly.
