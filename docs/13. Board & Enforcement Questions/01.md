# Q1 - Can the Board initiate an investigation on its own, or only based on complaints?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* gives the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** a **broad mandate** to act both on **complaints** and on **its own initiative**, depending on the source of information it receives.

### **1. Board’s Power to Act**

> **Section 27(1)** –  
> The Board may initiate inquiries and impose penalties when:  
> - It receives an **intimation of a personal-data breach** from a Data Fiduciary.  
> - A **Data Principal files a complaint** regarding a breach or rights violation.  
> - It receives a **reference** from the Central or State Government.  
> - It acts **in compliance with a court direction**.  
> - It receives information about a **Consent Manager’s registration breach**.

While the Act does not use the exact phrase *suo motu* (on its own motion), **Section 28(3-5)** empowers the Board to **determine whether sufficient grounds exist to proceed with an inquiry**, and to do so **“into the affairs of any person”** to verify compliance. This effectively allows **self-initiated investigations** once a credible basis arises from a breach notice, reference, or other trigger.

### **2. Complaint-Based vs. Self-Initiated Action**

| **Mode of Action** | **Trigger Source** | **Example Scenario** |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Complaint-Based** | A Data Principal or Consent Manager files a complaint | A user complains that a fintech app leaked personal data. |
| **Government-Referred** | Central/State Government or court reference | The government refers a suspected CERT-In violation. |
| **Self-Initiated (Quasi Suo Motu)** | Board determines sufficient grounds after a breach notification or monitoring | The Board notices multiple breach reports from a sector and opens an inquiry. |

---

:::info Example
If a Data Fiduciary reports a major data breach, the Board **can initiate an inquiry directly**—it does **not** need a user complaint. It may also issue **urgent mitigation or remedial directions** under **Section 27(1)(a)** and later impose penalties if violations are confirmed.

### **3. Due-Process Safeguards**

During any self-initiated or complaint-based inquiry:
- The Board must follow **principles of natural justice** (Section 28 (6)).  
- It must **record written reasons** for opening or closing the case.  
- The concerned party must be given an **opportunity to be heard**.  
- Interim orders or directions may be issued only **with justification** in writing.

---

### **4. Key Takeaway**

The **Data Protection Board** can:
- Begin action **on receipt of complaints**, **government references**, or **breach reports**, and  
- Conduct **its own inquiry** when it determines that sufficient grounds exist — effectively giving it **quasi-suo-motu powers**.  

Thus, the Board is not limited to waiting for complaints; it can act proactively to protect individuals’ data rights.
