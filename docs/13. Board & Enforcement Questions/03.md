# Q3 - How does the appeal process to the Appellate Tribunal work in practice?

:::tip Answer
If a company, individual, or Consent Manager disagrees with a decision made by the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** — for example, a penalty, directive, or interim order — they can **appeal to the Appellate Tribunal**.  The appeal mechanism under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* is designed to ensure **independent, fair, and time-bound review** of the Board’s decisions.

### **1. Legal Foundation**

> **Section 29(1)** —  
> *Any person aggrieved by an order or direction made by the Board may prefer an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal.*

This means **any affected party** — whether a company (Data Fiduciary or Processor), an individual (Data Principal), or a Consent Manager — can file an appeal if they believe the Board’s order is unjust, excessive, or incorrect in fact or law.

### **2. Timeline for Filing an Appeal**

> **Section 29(2–3)** —  
> - An appeal must be filed **within 60 days** from the date of receiving the Board’s order.  
> - The Tribunal may **allow late filing** if there is “sufficient cause” for the delay, such as pending evidence, system issues, or unavoidable circumstances.

This ensures that appellants get a **reasonable window** to prepare a factual and legal challenge.

### **3. Where and How to File**

In practice, the **Appellate Tribunal** is expected to be the same body as the **Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)** — designated to hear DPDPA appeals until a dedicated Data Protection Tribunal is formally established.

**Filing steps:**
1. Submit an **Appeal Petition** in the prescribed form (to be notified in DPDPA Rules).  
2. Attach the **impugned Board order**, supporting documents, and proof of payment of the prescribed appeal fee.  
3. Serve a **copy of the appeal** to the DPBI and any other parties involved.  
4. Provide a **verified statement of facts**, legal grounds, and requested relief (e.g., penalty reduction, order reversal, or stay).

### **4. What Happens After Filing**

> **Section 29(4)** —  
> The Tribunal, after giving all parties an **opportunity to be heard**, may:
> - **Confirm** the Board’s order,  
> - **Modify** it (e.g., reduce penalty), or  
> - **Set it aside** entirely.

In most cases, the Tribunal:
- Issues **notices** to both parties (appellant and DPBI).  
- Schedules a **hearing** where both sides can present evidence and arguments.  
- Examines procedural fairness, proportionality of penalties, and whether due process was followed by the Board.  
- May **grant interim relief** (such as staying a penalty) while the appeal is pending.

:::info Example
A fintech startup receives a ₹15 crore penalty for delayed breach notification. The company appeals to the Tribunal, presenting server logs showing the breach was reported within 6 hours to CERT-In and the DPBI. After review, the Tribunal reduces the penalty, citing good-faith compliance and technical proof.

### **5. Timeframe for Decision**

> **Section 29(6)** —  
> The Tribunal must aim to **dispose of appeals within six months** from the date of filing.  
>  
> **Section 29(7)** —  
> If it cannot do so, the Tribunal must **record reasons in writing** for the delay.

This ensures accountability and avoids indefinite pendency of appeals — a major step toward faster data-protection adjudication.

---

### **6. Post-Appeal Options**

Once the Tribunal issues its decision:
- Either party (the company or the Board) may **accept and comply**, or  
- If dissatisfied, may **challenge the Tribunal’s order before the High Court** under general judicial-review powers (Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India).

### **7. Practical Tips for Companies**

To strengthen an appeal:
1. Maintain **detailed documentation** during the Board inquiry (emails, audit logs, notices).  
2. Engage **legal counsel** experienced in data protection and administrative law.  
3. File appeals **digitally and promptly**, ensuring all procedural steps are met.  
4. Request **interim relief** if the Board’s order causes immediate harm (e.g., business disruption).  
5. Preserve **records of mitigation steps** (security upgrades, user notifications) — they often influence the Tribunal’s decision.

---

### **8. Key Takeaway**

- The Appellate Tribunal provides an **independent, quasi-judicial layer of review** for DPDPA cases.  
- Appeals must be filed within **60 days** (extendable).  
- Companies can **contest evidence, present new material, and seek interim relief**.  
- Decisions are typically expected **within six months**, ensuring timely resolution and procedural fairness.
