# Q4 - Can the Board impose non-financial remedies apart from fines?

:::tip Answer
Yes. The *Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)* has the authority to impose **non-financial remedies** — such as directions, corrective orders, and voluntary undertakings — in addition to monetary penalties. This ensures that enforcement under the DPDPA is **not only punitive** but also **corrective and preventive** in nature.

### **1. Corrective Directions Under Section 27(2)**

> **Section 27(2)** —  
> The Board may, after giving the person concerned an opportunity of being heard and recording reasons in writing, **issue such directions as it may consider necessary**, and such person **shall be bound to comply** with them.

This means the Board can:
- Order a company to **stop processing** certain categories of data.  
- Direct it to **implement stronger security controls** or **modify consent mechanisms**.  
- Require **data deletion**, **breach mitigation**, or **system audits**.  
- Instruct companies to **notify affected users** about violations or breaches.

:::info Example  
If a health-tech startup is found collecting patient data without explicit consent, the Board may **order it to suspend such processing**, **purge unlawfully collected data**, and **revise consent workflows**, even before any fine is imposed.

### **2. Voluntary Undertakings Under Section 32**

> **Section 32(1–3)** —  
> The Board may **accept a voluntary undertaking** from any person in respect of compliance with this Act, which may include commitments to:  
> - Take certain actions within a defined time,  
> - Refrain from specific practices, or  
> - Publicly disclose compliance steps.

> **Section 32(4)** —  
> Once accepted, this undertaking **bars further proceedings** on that matter — unless breached.  
>  
> **Section 32(5)** —  
> If breached, it is treated as a **violation of the Act**, and penalties can then be imposed.

This mechanism encourages organizations to **self-correct** through compliance plans rather than facing immediate penalties.

:::info Example  
A social-media platform voluntarily agrees to **introduce parental consent verification** for minors within 45 days. The Board accepts this as a **voluntary undertaking** and halts further inquiry — provided the company meets its commitment.
:::

### **3. Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution**

> **Section 31** —  
> The Board may direct parties to **resolve a complaint through mediation**, using a mutually agreed mediator.

This provision helps **avoid litigation** and promotes cooperative resolution, especially in disputes between Data Fiduciaries and Data Principals.

### **4. Range of Non-Financial Remedies**

| **Type of Remedy** | **Legal Basis** | **Description** |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Remedial Directions** | Section 27(2) | Orders to correct or halt non-compliant processing. |
| **Voluntary Undertakings** | Section 32 | Commitments by the company to rectify issues proactively. |
| **Mediation** | Section 31 | Encouraged resolution of disputes through dialogue. |
| **Operational Restrictions** | Section 27(2) | Suspension or limitation of data activities until compliance. |
| **Public Disclosure Orders** | Section 32(2) | Requiring the entity to publicly state compliance steps. |

### **5. Key Takeaway**

The DPDPA empowers the Board to **do more than impose fines**.  
It can:
- **Order corrective actions**,  
- **Suspend operations**,  
- **Encourage voluntary compliance**, and  
- **Facilitate mediation**.  

These powers ensure that enforcement focuses on **behavioral correction**, **systemic improvement**, and **data protection accountability**, not just monetary punishment.
