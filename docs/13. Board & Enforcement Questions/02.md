# Q2 - What rights do companies have during an investigation — can they contest evidence?
:::tip Answer
- Yes. Investigations must follow principles of natural justice:  
- Companies have the right to be heard, present their side, and contest evidence before penalties are imposed.  
- They can submit internal reports, forensic evidence, and explanations.  
- If the Board issues an order, the company can appeal to the Appellate Tribunal under Rule 21.

:::info Example
- If ABC Insurance Ltd. is accused of mishandling health data, it may submit logs showing it was actually the Data Processor’s fault.  
- The Board must consider this evidence before penalizing ABC.
