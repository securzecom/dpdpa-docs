# Q2 - What rights do companies have during an investigation — can they contest evidence?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, organizations under investigation by the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** enjoy clear **procedural and evidentiary rights**. The Act explicitly requires that **all inquiries follow the principles of natural justice**, meaning every company has the right to **defend itself, contest evidence, and appeal decisions**.
:::

---

### **1. Right to a Fair Hearing**

> **Section 28(6)** —  
> The Board shall conduct every inquiry **following the principles of natural justice** and must **record reasons** for its actions.

This guarantees that no organization can be penalized or held liable without being:
- **Informed of the allegations**,  
- **Given an opportunity to be heard**, and  
- **Allowed to present documents, evidence, or witnesses** in its defense.

---

### **2. Right to Contest Evidence and Cross-Examine**

> **Section 28(7)** —  
> The Board has powers equal to a **civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908**, including the power to:
> - Summon and examine witnesses under oath,  
> - Require **discovery and production of documents**, and  
> - **Receive evidence on affidavit** or inspect data, books, or registers.

These provisions mean companies may:
- **Challenge the authenticity or relevance** of evidence presented against them,  
- **Submit counter-evidence** (technical reports, logs, audit trails, etc.),  
- **Cross-examine witnesses** or experts presented by the Board, and  
- Request inspection of materials being relied upon during the inquiry.

:::info Example
If the Board claims a company failed to secure customer data, the company can present **incident logs, encryption reports, or vendor contracts** proving compliance and contest any inaccurate or misleading evidence.

### **3. Protection from Disruptive Seizure or Overreach**

> **Section 28(8)** —  
> The Board or its officers **cannot seize or take into custody any equipment** in a way that disrupts the company’s day-to-day functioning.

This prevents arbitrary shutdowns or operational paralysis during investigations — ensuring fairness while preserving business continuity.

---

### **4. Right to Interim and Final Representation**

> **Section 28(10)–(11)** —  
> The Board may issue **interim orders** only **after giving the concerned person an opportunity of being heard**.  
> Upon completing the inquiry, it must again give the organization a **final opportunity to present its defense** before deciding on penalties.

Thus, a company has the right to **respond at multiple stages** — both before temporary directions and before final penalties.

---

### **5. Right to Appeal**

> **Section 29(1–5)** —  
> Any person aggrieved by an order or direction of the Board may **appeal to the Appellate Tribunal** within **60 days** of receiving the order.

The Tribunal can:
- **Confirm, modify, or set aside** the Board’s decision;  
- **Accept delayed appeals** if justified; and  
- Must decide cases **expeditiously (within six months)**.

This gives companies a **structured appellate remedy** similar to judicial review, ensuring checks and balances against arbitrary action.

---

### **6. Key Takeaway**

During a DPDPA investigation, companies have the right to:
- A **fair and transparent inquiry**;  
- **Access and challenge evidence**;  
- **Submit counter-proof and witness statements**;  
- **Protection from operational disruption**; and  
- **Appeal any adverse orders** to an independent Tribunal.

These safeguards uphold the **principles of due process** while allowing the Data Protection Board to enforce accountability effectively.
