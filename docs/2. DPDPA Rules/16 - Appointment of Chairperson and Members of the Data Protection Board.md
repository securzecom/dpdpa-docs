Rule 16 outlines the **procedure for appointing the Chairperson and Members** of the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)**, establishing transparency, merit, and institutional integrity in its composition. It mandates the formation of dedicated **Search-cum-Selection Committees** to identify qualified candidates for both roles.

### 1. Governance and Oversight  

The **Central Government** is the appointing authority but relies on two independent Search-cum-Selection Committees for recommendations. This structure ensures checks and balances, combining administrative oversight with technical expertise.

### 2. Appointment Procedure  

The process unfolds in three structured steps:  
1. **Constitution of Committees** by the Central Government.  
2. **Shortlisting and Recommendation** of suitable individuals by these Committees based on merit, expertise, and reputation.  
3. **Final Appointment** of the Chairperson and Members by the Central Government after assessing the recommendations.  

This process ensures that the Board’s composition reflects both administrative capability and subject-matter depth in areas essential for digital governance.

### 3. Validity of Committee Proceedings  

Sub-rule (4) provides a continuity clause, stating that the validity of the Committee’s actions cannot be challenged merely due to any **vacancy, absence, or defect** in its constitution. This safeguard prevents procedural interruptions and ensures that appointments and related decisions remain valid despite minor administrative anomalies.  

When a statutory committee is formed, its functioning could be challenged in court if, for example, a member resigns, is absent during deliberations, or if a minor procedural lapse occurs in its constitution. Sub-rule (4) anticipates this and prevents such disruptions. It states that any decision or recommendation made by the Committee remains legally valid even if a vacancy arises or there is an irregularity in how the committee was composed.

This ensures administrative continuity — meaning the process of appointing the Chairperson or Members of the Data Protection Board will not be delayed or invalidated due to technical flaws. For instance, if one of the expert members is unavailable during a meeting or their appointment letter is issued late, the Committee’s recommendations still stand valid.

In legal terms, this clause protects the legitimacy of proceedings against procedural or technical objections, as long as the core intent of due process and fair selection is maintained. It reflects the principle that substance should prevail over form, safeguarding the governance mechanism from avoidable delays or judicial bottlenecks.

Sub-rule (4) thus acts as a stability clause — ensuring that minor administrative lapses do not derail the appointment process or compromise the operational readiness of the Data Protection Board.

### 4. Strategic Significance  

The inclusion of **independent experts** signifies the Government’s intent to maintain a balanced and multidisciplinary decision-making framework. The presence of legal, administrative, and technical experts fosters credibility and ensures that the Data Protection Board operates with a nuanced understanding of privacy, technology, and regulatory enforcement.  

Securze advises enterprises and institutions interacting with the DPBI to maintain transparent compliance documentation and readiness for any Board-led proceedings or reviews.

Rule 16 formalises the **appointment mechanism** of the Data Protection Board’s leadership. By establishing expert-driven selection committees, it ensures impartiality, technical depth, and administrative efficiency in the constitution of the Board.
