# Rule 1: Short Title and Commencement

This rule specifies that the regulations shall be called the **Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025**.  
It also states that the rules will come into effect on dates notified by the **Central Government**. Different provisions may commence at different times, allowing for a **phased implementation approach**.

**Why does this matter?**  
For organizations, knowing the commencement date is critical. Compliance cannot be built overnight.  

:::danger Critical Point
If the government says that all breach notifications must follow **Rule 7 from 1st July 2025**, then a bank, an insurance company, or even a small e-commerce startup must have its breach reporting systems ready **before that date**.

**Example scenario**  

:::info Example
Imagine **XYZ Insurance Ltd.** is processing health claims and holding sensitive medical data. If **Rule 6 (reasonable security safeguards)** is enforced from **1st September 2025**, the company must have **encryption, access control, and audit logs** implemented before that date. Otherwise, any breach that occurs after enforcement could lead to heavy penalties.

Similarly, a social media platform like **ABC Connect** cannot delay setting up its consent withdrawal feature just because it is technically challenging. Once the rule comes into effect, excuses won’t matter — compliance becomes mandatory.
