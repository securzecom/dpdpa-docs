(1) The Chairperson shall fix the date, time and place of meetings of the Board, approve the items of agenda therefor, and cause notice specifying the same to be issued under her signature or that of such other individual as the Chairperson may authorise by general or special order in writing.  

(2) Meetings of the Board shall be chaired by the Chairperson and, in her absence, by such other Member as the Members present at the meeting may choose from amongst themselves.  

(3) One-third of the membership of the Board shall be the quorum for its meetings.

Rule 18 explains **how the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** conducts its meetings, takes decisions, and formally issues or signs its orders. It ensures the Board works in an organised, transparent, and accountable manner — similar to how other quasi-judicial bodies function in India.  

---

### 1. Setting up Meetings  

The **Chairperson** is responsible for fixing the **date, time, and place** of every meeting. He/She also approves the **agenda** — that is, the list of topics to be discussed — and signs the official **notice** inviting Members. If needed, he/she can authorise another officer in writing to issue such notices.  

:::info Example  
Suppose the Board needs to discuss multiple privacy-violation complaints from different companies. The Chairperson sets the meeting for Monday 10 a.m., approves the agenda (case list), and directs her office to send official notices to all Members.  
:::

---

### 2. Who Chairs the Meeting  

Normally, the **Chairperson** leads the meeting. If he/she is absent, Members present can **choose one among themselves** to chair the session, ensuring the meeting still takes place. This avoids delays or cancellations when the Chairperson is unavailable.  

---

### 3. Minimum Attendance (Quorum)  

At least **one-third of the total Members** must be present for the meeting to be valid. This rule prevents a very small number of Members from taking decisions on behalf of the whole Board.  

:::info Example  
If the Board has nine Members, at least three must be present to begin official business.  
:::

---

### 4. How Decisions Are Made  

All decisions are taken **by majority vote** of Members present. If there’s a tie — for example, 3 votes for and 3 votes against — the **Chairperson (or acting chair)** gets an **extra or “casting” vote** to break the tie.  

:::info Example  
During a vote on imposing a fine, the Board splits 2-2. The Chairperson then uses her casting vote to reach a final decision.  
:::

---

### 5. Conflict of Interest  

If a Member has any **personal or professional interest** in a case being discussed — for example, a past relationship with the company under investigation — that Member **must not participate or vote**. This ensures fairness and objectivity.  

:::tip  
Transparency builds public trust. Declaring conflicts of interest early protects both the Board and its Members from allegations of bias.  
:::

---

### 6. Emergency Decisions  

Sometimes urgent situations arise where waiting for a meeting could cause harm — such as a large-scale data breach needing immediate action. In such cases, the **Chairperson may act alone**, recording the reasons in writing. Her decision must then be:  

1. **Shared with all Members within seven days**, and  
2. **Formally approved (“ratified”)** at the next meeting.  

:::info Example  
If a company’s servers are leaking sensitive citizen data, the Chairperson can issue an immediate suspension order without waiting for a meeting. The order is later presented to the Board for review and confirmation.  
:::

:::info Example  
A major national e-governance platform hosting millions of Aadhaar-linked service records suffers a ransomware attack, causing exposure of personal information such as names, addresses, and partial ID numbers. 

Because the breach impacts public systems and risks nationwide data misuse, the **Chairperson may immediately direct** the affected organisation to disable public access, initiate forensic investigation, and inform CERT-In.  

The action, though taken urgently without a Board meeting, must be **reported within seven days** and **ratified in the next session** to maintain procedural transparency.  
:::

---

### 7. Decisions by Circulation  

When an issue does not require discussion or a physical meeting, the Chairperson can **send the proposal by circulation** — usually via email or secure portal — to all Members. If a **majority approve**, the decision becomes valid. This method helps the Board act efficiently on routine or minor matters.  

---

### 8. Authentication of Orders and Directions  

Once the Board reaches a decision, the **Chairperson**, any **Member**, or an authorised officer can sign it under his/her name. This signature **authenticates** the order — making it an official and enforceable document.  

:::info  
Authentication is what gives legal effect to the Board’s decisions. Without it, an order or notice would not be valid in law.  
:::

---

### 9. Timelines for Inquiry Completion  

The Board must complete any **inquiry** within **six months** from the date it receives a complaint or direction under Section 27 of the Act. If more time is genuinely needed, the Board may extend the inquiry — but only after recording the **reason in writing** — for a **maximum of three months at a time**.  

:::info Example  
If a complex cross-border data-sharing case requires extra evidence, the Board can extend the inquiry from six to nine months, clearly noting the reason in its records.  
:::

Rule 18 provides a structured way for the Data Protection Board to conduct business fairly and efficiently. It covers how meetings are scheduled, how decisions are made, what to do in emergencies, and how official orders are signed. Together, these steps ensure that every action of the Board remains **transparent, accountable, and legally valid**.
