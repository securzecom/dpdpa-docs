# Rule 15: Exemptions for Research, Archiving, and Statistical Purposes

Rule 15 recognizes that not all processing of personal data serves commercial or service-related goals. Sometimes, data is required for **research, archiving, or statistical purposes**, and in such cases, certain exemptions are granted under the law.

---

**The rule provides that:**

- Personal data may be processed **without consent** if it is being used solely for research, archiving, or statistical purposes.  
- Such processing must be carried out in a way that does **not harm the rights of Data Principals** and does not identify individuals unless absolutely necessary.  
- The exemption applies only when the purpose is **genuine** and not a disguised attempt to use personal data for **commercial exploitation**.  

:::danger Critical Point
Exemptions under Rule 15 are allowed only when the purpose is **legitimate**. Any disguised commercial use of personal data will not qualify and will be treated as a violation.

**Example Scenarios**

:::info Example 1  
A **university research team** analyzing the spread of diabetes across different states may process **hospital admission data**. As long as the data is anonymized and individuals are not identifiable, the research can proceed without seeking consent from every patient.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
The **National Archives of India** may retain and process old **census data** for historical documentation, even though it contains personal details of individuals who lived decades ago.  
:::

:::info Example 3  
A **manufacturing industry association** may collect **employment statistics** from factories across India to study labor trends. The study can use personal data in aggregate form without asking every worker for consent, provided **individual identities remain protected**.

The intention behind **Rule 15** is to promote **knowledge, preserve history, and enable evidence-based policymaking**, while ensuring that such processing does not become a backdoor for misusing personal information. It strikes a balance between **societal benefit** and **individual privacy**.
