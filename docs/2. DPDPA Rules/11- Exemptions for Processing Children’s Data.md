# Rule 11: Exemptions for Processing Children’s Data

While **Rule 10** requires parental or guardian consent before processing a child’s personal data, **Rule 11** introduces certain exemptions. These exemptions exist because not every instance of handling a child’s data poses a risk, and the law recognizes the need for practical flexibility.

---

**Under this rule:**

- The **Central Government** may specify classes of **Data Fiduciaries** or certain purposes for which **verifiable parental consent** is not mandatory.  
- Such exemptions are allowed only when the processing of a child’s data is considered **safe** and does not pose any harm to the child’s **rights or well-being**.  
- The exemptions are meant to strike a balance: **protecting children** without unnecessarily obstructing services that are **beneficial or harmless**.  

:::danger Critical Point
Exemptions apply **only when processing is harmless and safe**. Any activity that could risk a child’s rights or well-being will still require verifiable parental consent.

**Example Scenarios**

:::info Example 1  
An educational technology platform like **ABC Learning App** may be exempted from parental consent if it only processes **basic login details and study progress** to deliver lessons to school students, and does not use the data for targeted advertising.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
A government examination board collecting information about students to issue **hall tickets or results** may process data without requiring every parent to separately give consent, since the activity is clearly safe, necessary, and in the child’s interest.  
:::

:::info Example 3  
A healthcare research project studying **vaccination coverage in children** may be allowed to process anonymized or limited data without parental approvals, provided **safeguards** are in place to prevent misuse.

The underlying principle is **risk-based regulation**. If the processing is **harmless, clearly beneficial, and carried out with safeguards**, then parental consent should not become a bureaucratic hurdle. At the same time, the **government retains the power** to decide which activities qualify, ensuring that the exemption is not misused.
