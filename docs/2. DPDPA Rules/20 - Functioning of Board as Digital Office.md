# Rule 20: Functioning of Board as Digital Office

<details>
<summary><strong>20. Functioning of Board as digital office</strong></summary>

The Board shall function as a digital office, without prejudice to its power to summon and enforce the attendance of any person and examine her on oath, and may adopt techno-legal measures to conduct proceedings in a manner that does not require physical presence of any individual.

Rule 20 highlights that the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** is designed to operate as a **fully digital and technology-driven office**. This means most of its work — including complaint filings, hearings, document reviews, and orders — will happen **online** rather than through physical meetings.  

The goal is to make the process **faster, transparent, and accessible** to people and organisations across India, without requiring anyone to travel to Delhi or another central location.

### 1. What “Digital Office” Means  

A digital office is an organisation that uses secure digital tools instead of paper-based or in-person procedures. For the Board, this means:  
- Complaints and responses are submitted through an **online portal**.  
- Hearings may be conducted via **video conferencing**.  
- Orders, notices, and directions are **digitally signed** and delivered electronically.  
- Case files, evidence, and logs are stored in **secure, encrypted systems**.  

:::info Example  
A startup in Chennai faces a complaint from a user about mishandling of personal data. Instead of visiting Delhi for a hearing, both parties upload their submissions on the Board’s web portal and attend the hearing virtually through a secure video link. The Chairperson reviews the evidence digitally and issues an electronically signed order.

### 2. Techno-Legal Measures  

The rule allows the Board to use **“techno-legal measures”**, which means combining **technology** and **law** to conduct secure, valid, and enforceable digital proceedings. Such measures can include:  
- Digital authentication (e-signatures, digital certificates).  
- Encryption of evidence and documents.  
- AI-assisted case management or document scanning tools.  
- Secure online hearing platforms compliant with Indian IT Act standards.  

These measures ensure that digital proceedings are **legally binding** and cannot be challenged simply because they were conducted online. This setup helps manage cases efficiently — especially important in a country as large as India, where digital hearings save time and resources for both the Board and the parties involved.

### 3. Power to Summon Individuals  

Even though the Board mainly operates online, it still retains all its **legal powers**.  
If a case requires physical verification or sworn testimony, the Board can **summon any person** and **examine them on oath** — just like a traditional court or tribunal. So, being a digital office does not limit its legal authority; it simply changes how day-to-day work is done.

If the Board is investigating a serious data breach involving national security data, it can still summon a company’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or technical head for in-person questioning under oath.

### 4. Benefits of the Digital Office Model  

The digital approach ensures:  
- **Faster resolution** of complaints without administrative delays.  
- **Cost savings** for companies and individuals (no travel or physical paperwork).  
- **Inclusivity**, allowing participation from anywhere in India or abroad.  
- **Transparency**, since all actions are digitally recorded and traceable.

A data protection complaint filed by an individual in Guwahati can be handled by the Board in Delhi entirely through online systems. The complainant receives updates via email or dashboard notifications — ensuring access to justice without distance barriers.

### 5. Human-Centered Design  

Beyond technology, the “digital office” approach aims to make compliance and justice more **user-friendly**. Interfaces will likely include guided forms, document upload features, and help sections to assist non-technical users. This human-first design helps ensure that small businesses, startups, and individuals can interact with the Board without needing legal intermediaries for every step.

Rule 20 transforms the Data Protection Board into a **modern, online-first authority**. It combines technology and law to make hearings, filings, and decisions digital — without reducing the Board’s powers. This ensures **speed, inclusivity, and transparency**, while keeping every order and proceeding legally valid and enforceable.
