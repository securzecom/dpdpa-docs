# Rule 22: Power to Call for Information from Data Fiduciaries or Intermediaries

Rule 22 equips the **Data Protection Board of India** with the authority to **demand information** from organizations involved in data processing. This rule is crucial because the Board cannot effectively enforce the law without access to detailed records, evidence, and clarifications from **Data Fiduciaries** and **intermediaries**.

---

**What the Rule Provides**

- The Board may call for **any information** it considers necessary from a **Data Fiduciary** (the entity that decides how data is processed) or an **intermediary** (such as an internet service provider, platform, or hosting provider) to carry out its functions under the Act.  
- The request for information must be complied with **in the form and within the time specified** by the Board.  
- Failure to provide **accurate or timely information** can itself be treated as a **violation**, exposing the organization to penalties.  
- The details of the **authorized persons** who can call for such information, and the purposes for which it may be sought, are set out in **Schedule VII** of the Rules.  

:::danger Critical Point
Failure to comply with the Board’s information requests — whether by delay, omission, or inaccuracy — may itself amount to a **legal violation** carrying penalties.

**Why This is Important**

Without the ability to demand information, the Board’s powers would be limited. Investigating a breach, verifying compliance, or resolving a grievance requires access to **technical and organizational records**.  

Rule 22 ensures that the Board can look *“under the hood”* of any organization when needed.

**Example Scenarios**

:::info Example 1  
A **stock broking firm** reports a suspected breach but provides only vague details. The Board can formally demand **system logs, encryption policies, and records of breach detection** under Rule 22.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
A **telecom company** accused of illegally sharing call data with advertisers can be ordered to provide **agreements, logs, and data transfer records**.  
:::

:::info Example 3  
A **social media platform** may be required to disclose how its **consent management system** functions if users complain that consent withdrawals are being ignored.

**Rule 22** reinforces the Board’s role as a **proactive regulator**. It ensures that organizations cannot withhold information or provide incomplete responses during inquiries.  

By mandating cooperation, it strengthens **accountability** and makes enforcement of the DPDPA more **effective**.
