Rule 22 empowers the **Central Government** to call for specific information from any **Data Fiduciary** (such as a company, organisation, or government body handling personal data) or **intermediary** (like social media platforms, online marketplaces, or service providers). This authority helps the government ensure compliance, monitor potential risks, and protect national interests under the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA)**.

### 1. Purpose of the Rule  

The main purpose of Rule 22 is to give the Central Government the legal right to **request information directly** from entities that process or manage personal data. Such requests can be made only for specific, pre-defined reasons listed in the **Seventh Schedule** — for example, monitoring compliance, national security, or public interest investigations.  

This ensures that the power is **not arbitrary** but used only within the limits of law.  

:::info Example  
If the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) needs details from a social media company about how it stores Indian users’ data in relation to a national cybersecurity review, it can officially request this information under Rule 22, within the framework specified in the Seventh Schedule.  
:::

### 2. Role of Authorised Persons  

The rule mentions “**corresponding authorised person**,” which means only specific government officers — designated under the Seventh Schedule — are allowed to make such requests. This prevents misuse or informal data demands by unauthorised individuals.  

Each authorised person represents a specific purpose. For example:  
- A designated cybersecurity officer may request data related to cyber incidents.  
- A compliance officer from MeitY may request audit records related to DPDPA implementation.  

:::tip  
All requests must be made formally, in writing or digitally signed, and specify **what data is needed**, **why it is needed**, and **how long the entity has to respond**.

### 3. Sensitivity and National Security  

If the requested information involves sensitive or classified matters — for instance, those affecting India’s **sovereignty**, **security**, or **public order** — the rule allows the government to restrict any public disclosure about the request itself.  

This means the Data Fiduciary or intermediary **cannot reveal** that such a request was made unless they have written permission from the authorised government officer.  

:::info Example  
If a major cloud service provider receives an official notice asking for logs related to a suspected foreign cyberattack on critical infrastructure, it cannot publicly announce or discuss this request without written permission, as doing so could endanger national security.  
:::

### 4. Fulfilment under Section 36 of the Act  

Rule 22(2) clarifies that providing information to the government under this rule is considered a **legal obligation** under **Section 36 of the DPDPA**. In other words, Data Fiduciaries and intermediaries must cooperate and respond within the prescribed time, or they could be held non-compliant under the Act.  

This also protects organisations from liability when they share data in good faith as part of a lawful government request.  

:::tip  
If a company receives a lawful information request under Rule 22, responding accurately and on time fulfills its legal duty — it does not violate data privacy or confidentiality obligations, since the disclosure is authorised by law.  
:::

### 5. Importance of Transparency and Safeguards  

While this rule empowers the government, it also implies that every such request should:  
- Have a **clear purpose** under the Seventh Schedule.  
- Be made by an **authorised person** only.  
- Maintain **records of the request** for accountability.  
- Protect the **privacy of unrelated individuals** whose data is not relevant to the purpose.  

This balance between **state security** and **citizen privacy** is at the heart of India’s data governance model.  

:::info Example  
A payment gateway receives a request for transaction logs related to suspected fraud. The company must share only the information relevant to the investigation — not the entire customer database. This respects privacy while fulfilling legal duties.  
:::

### 6. Real-World Context  

In practical terms, this rule supports India’s national digital infrastructure and helps the government:  
- Investigate large-scale cyber incidents.  
- Monitor cross-border data transfers when needed.  
- Ensure that companies handling personal data comply with DPDPA obligations.  

At the same time, it encourages **trust and accountability** — since requests must be made through authorised channels, not arbitrary enforcement.  

---

### Summary  

Rule 22 allows the Central Government, through authorised officials, to request specific information from Data Fiduciaries or intermediaries for legitimate and predefined purposes under the Seventh Schedule. It ensures that such data requests are **lawful, time-bound, and secure**, while still upholding the principles of **privacy protection** and **national security**.
