# Rule 6: Reasonable Security Safeguards

Rule 6 requires every **Data Fiduciary** to implement **reasonable security safeguards** to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss. The obligation is proactive, meaning organizations must secure data **before** problems occur rather than waiting until after a breach.

---

**Under this rule:**

- Security safeguards must include appropriate **technical measures** such as **encryption, pseudonymization, secure storage systems, and access controls**.  
- **Organizational measures** such as staff training, role-based access, internal policies, and periodic audits are also required to minimize risks of human error or negligence.  
- Safeguards should be **proportionate** to the nature and volume of data processed, meaning that a **large bank** handling sensitive financial data will be expected to have stronger protections compared to a small local retailer collecting only email addresses.  
- **Regular review and updating** of security measures is mandatory to keep up with evolving technology and threats.

**Example Scenarios**

:::info Example 1  
A stock broking firm that processes customer trading histories and PAN details must use **end-to-end encryption** and **two-factor authentication** to prevent account takeovers.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
An e-commerce company like **ABC Mart Online** should **encrypt payment details, maintain secure backups, and restrict employee access** to only the data required for their role.  
:::

:::info Example 3  
A hospital chain storing patient medical histories must ensure that only **authorized doctors** can view health records, with **audit logs** showing who accessed the data and when.

:::danger Critical Point  
Failure to adopt reasonable safeguards may not only result in **penalties** but also increase the severity of consequences if a breach occurs. By embedding security as a core responsibility, **Rule 6** makes it clear that protecting personal data is not optional but a **legal duty**.
