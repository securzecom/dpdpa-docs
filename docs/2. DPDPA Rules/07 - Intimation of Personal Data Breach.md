Rule 7 specifies the precise **notification obligations** following a personal-data breach. It requires prompt, transparent communication to both the affected individuals and the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)**.  

The goal is twofold: to enable citizens to protect themselves, and to help the regulator assess the adequacy of the organisation‚Äôs safeguards and response.

---


### 1. Immediate Notification to Affected Individuals  

When a breach occurs‚Äîwhether accidental or malicious‚Äîthe Data Fiduciary must promptly notify every affected Data Principal in clear and plain language. The notification should describe what happened, what data may have been exposed, potential consequences, steps already taken by the organisation, and recommended protective measures for users.  

:::info Example
If a mobile-wallet application detects that an attacker accessed user profiles, the company must inform users through their registered email or in-app alerts. Messages should avoid jargon and state facts such as the date, scope, and immediate next steps (e.g., password reset, credit-monitoring advice).  
:::

Transparent and empathetic messaging strengthens trust and reduces reputational impact. Delay or concealment can be viewed as non-compliance, leading to penalties under the DPDPA.

</details>

### 2. Structured Reporting to the Data Protection Board  

In addition to user communication, the Data Fiduciary must report every breach to the **DPBI**. The rule divides the reporting obligation into two phases:  

- **Initial Notification (Without Delay):** A short preliminary report sent immediately after detection, summarising the nature, extent, timing, and probable impact of the breach.  
- **Detailed Report (Within 72 Hours):** A comprehensive submission including investigation findings, sequence of events, root cause, corrective measures, responsible individuals (if identified), and evidence of notifications sent to users.  

The 72-hour limit mirrors global best practices. The Board may allow a longer period in exceptional circumstances, but the fiduciary must formally request it in writing with justification.  

An effective process requires internal playbooks defining escalation paths: detection ‚Üí assessment ‚Üí legal & DPO review ‚Üí Board notification ‚Üí public/user communication.

---

### 3. Understanding ‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù of a Breach  

The 72-hour window begins **when the organisation becomes aware** that a breach involving personal data has occurred‚Äînot merely when an incident is first suspected.  

Awareness typically means confirmation through initial investigation, detection systems, or reports from processors. Therefore, organisations must maintain robust **incident-detection and verification procedures** to avoid ambiguity about when ‚Äúawareness‚Äù begins.

---

### 4. Communication Channels and User Accounts  

Rule 7(3) defines ‚Äúuser account‚Äù broadly to include all forms of digital presence used to access services‚Äîsuch as web portals, apps, email, or registered phone numbers. Fiduciaries must ensure at least one reliable communication mode is always valid and tested.  

:::info Example:
A bank, for instance, may issue breach notifications through its secure portal and SMS, while an e-commerce firm may notify users via email and in-app alerts. Multi-channel notification ensures no affected user remains uninformed.
:::

---

### 5. Content and Tone of Notifications  

Notifications must be **factual, concise, and instructive**, avoiding speculation or blame. They should list what data was affected, likely consequences (identity theft, phishing risk, financial loss), steps already taken (password resets, account freezes), and guidance for user protection (update credentials, monitor statements, enable MFA).  

Each message must include contact details of a responsible person‚Äîoften the **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** or an authorised representative‚Äîso users can seek clarifications. This transparency demonstrates accountability and empathy, reducing potential complaints.

:::tip Best practices for sending breach notifications  
- Always use the **same channels** your users normally rely on ‚Äî for example, in-app alerts, registered email addresses, or verified SMS gateways ‚Äî ensuring authenticity and immediate visibility.  
- Use **secure, verified domains** to avoid phishing confusion, and digitally sign or brand the communication so recipients trust its origin.  
- When notifying a large user base, adopt a **multi-channel approach** (email + app + SMS) and ensure all messages are synchronised in content and timing.  
- Maintain **delivery logs** and screenshots as evidence of compliance in case the Data Protection Board requests proof of user intimation.  
:::


---

### 6. Internal Coordination and Evidence Preservation  

Compliance depends on well-designed breach-response governance. Security teams, DPOs, and legal advisors must coordinate seamlessly to document every step‚Äîdetection timestamps, decisions, and communications.  

Logs, screenshots, and reports form part of evidence demonstrating due diligence. Organisations using SOC and SIEM systems should tag incidents by severity and automatically trigger workflows for DPO review.  

Maintaining this documentation helps prove that the fiduciary acted ‚Äúwithout delay‚Äù and fulfilled all sub-clauses of Rule 7(2).

---

### 7. Example Scenarios  

:::info BFSI
A bank detects unauthorised database access revealing 500 customer PAN records. The bank immediately locks accounts, alerts affected customers via email/SMS, and informs DPBI within 24 hours with a detailed report following 48 hours later. This satisfies Rule 7.  
:::

:::info Healthcare 
A hospital‚Äôs billing system is hit by ransomware, encrypting patient files. The hospital notifies patients, explains potential disclosure of insurance details, informs DPBI within 72 hours, and outlines its mitigation and recovery plan.  
:::

:::danger Violation
A social-media app delays disclosure for weeks while conducting an internal inquiry. Users learn about the breach through the press. Even if later mitigated, the delay constitutes **non-compliance**, exposing the company to penalties and reputational damage.
:::
---

### 8. Building Readiness  

- Organisations should maintain a **Breach Response Playbook** aligned with Rule 7. 
- It must define severity tiers, notification templates, responsible teams, escalation matrices, and communication protocols with regulators and users. 
- Integrating these processes with existing SOC tools ensures real-time visibility and faster response. Periodic breach-simulation drills further strengthen preparedness.

### Summary  

Rule 7 transforms breach response from an optional act of goodwill into a **legal duty of transparency**.  
It demands that Data Fiduciaries act swiftly, notify both users and the Board, and demonstrate documented diligence.  
By maintaining strong detection systems, clear escalation channels, and pre-approved communication templates, organisations not only comply with DPDPA 2025 but also preserve public trust in times of crisis.
