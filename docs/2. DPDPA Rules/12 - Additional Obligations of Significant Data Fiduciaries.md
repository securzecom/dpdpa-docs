# Rule 12: Additional Obligations of Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)

Rule 12 sets out the enhanced responsibilities for **Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)**. These are entities identified by the **Central Government** on the basis of factors such as the **volume and sensitivity of personal data processed**, the **potential impact on the rights of individuals**, or concerns relating to **sovereignty, integrity, or public order**.

The obligations imposed on SDFs are designed to ensure a higher level of **accountability, transparency, and risk management**.  

---

**Under this rule, an SDF must:**

- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** to evaluate how its data processing activities affect the privacy of **Data Principals**.  
- Undergo **periodic independent audits** to verify compliance with the Act and the Rules.  
- Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**, who will be based in India and will serve as the point of contact for both the **Data Protection Board** and the **Data Principals**.  
- Put in place governance measures to ensure that **automated decision-making systems and algorithms** do not cause harm or unfair treatment to individuals.  
- Maintain **comprehensive records** of data processing activities, safeguards, and risk assessments, ready for inspection when demanded by the Board.

**Example**

:::info Example 1
A large **social media platform** processing millions of users’ photos, messages, and location details is highly likely to be classified as an **SDF**.  
It will therefore need to appoint a **DPO**, conduct **DPIAs** before introducing new features such as AI-driven recommendation engines, and submit to **independent audits** to ensure that user privacy is not compromised.  
:::

:::info Example 2
XYZ Online Health Platform, which **stores sensitive health records and personal information** of thousands of patients, must appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**, conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) before launching new AI-based diagnostic tools, undergo independent audits regularly, and ensure that automated decision-making does not harm or unfairly treat users.
