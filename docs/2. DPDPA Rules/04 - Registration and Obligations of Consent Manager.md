# Rule 4: Registration and Obligations of Consent Manager

Rule 4 establishes the framework for the **registration** and **functioning** of **Consent Managers**, which are specialized entities designed to help individuals manage their consents effectively.

---

**Registration Requirement**  
A Consent Manager must first be **registered with the Data Protection Board of India**. Registration is granted only if the entity demonstrates adequate **technical, financial, and organizational capacity** to perform its role in a reliable and secure manner.  

---

**Once registered, a Consent Manager has the following obligations:**

- It must provide a **platform** through which Data Principals can give, manage, review, and withdraw consent for the processing of their personal data.  
- It must ensure that the process of managing consent is **transparent, accessible, and simple**, without creating unnecessary hurdles for the Data Principal.  
- It must maintain **accurate records of consents** given and withdrawn, and provide proof of such records when required by the Data Principal or the Board.  
- It must implement **robust security safeguards** such as encryption, access controls, and audit logs to protect against unauthorized access or misuse.  
- It must remain a **neutral and independent entity**, acting only in the best interest of the Data Principal, and not show preference to any specific Data Fiduciary.  
- It must cooperate fully with the **Board** in audits, inspections, or inquiries relating to its operations.

:::danger Critical Point
Consent Managers must remain **neutral and independent**. They cannot favor any Data Fiduciary, and must always act only in the best interest of the Data Principal.

The role of **Consent Managers** is central to the DPDPA framework because they **empower individuals to exercise genuine control over their data**. By separating the management of consent from the Data Fiduciary, the law ensures that Data Principals are not forced into one-sided arrangements where their choices are limited.
