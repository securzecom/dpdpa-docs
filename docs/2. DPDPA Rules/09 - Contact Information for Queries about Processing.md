<details>
  <summary><strong>Statutory Text — Rule 9:Contact information of person to answer questions about processing.</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

Every Data Fiduciary shall prominently publish on its website or app, and mention in every response to a communication for the exercise of the rights of a Data Principal under the Act, the business contact information of the Data Protection Officer, if applicable, or a person who is able to answer on behalf of the Data Fiduciary the questions of the Data Principal about the processing of her personal data.

Rule 9 emphasises **transparency and accountability** by requiring every organisation that processes personal data to maintain an accessible point of contact — typically the **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** or a designated representative.  

The rule ensures that Data Principals (individuals) can easily reach out to ask how their data is being processed, stored, or shared, and receive timely and clear responses.

### 1. Public Disclosure Requirement  

The Data Fiduciary must **prominently publish** the contact details of its DPO or authorised contact person on its official website, mobile application, or user portal.  This information must be easy to locate — typically placed in the **Privacy Policy**, **Contact Us**, or **Data Protection / Legal** section of the site.  

For mobile applications, the contact details should be visible within the app’s settings or privacy section, not hidden behind multiple layers or external links.  

Acceptable formats include:  
- A dedicated email address such as **privacy@[companyname].com** or **dpo@[companyname].in**  
- A web form for privacy requests linked from the privacy notice  
- A phone number for urgent data-protection queries  

The contact must represent the organisation’s data-protection function, not a generic customer-support line.

### 2. Inclusion in Rights-Exercise Communications  

Whenever a Data Principal exercises her rights (for example, requests data access, correction, or erasure), the organisation’s response must **explicitly mention the DPO or responsible contact person’s business information**. This ensures that individuals know who is accountable and can escalate concerns if necessary.  

A compliant response might end with:  
> “If you have further questions about how your personal data is processed, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@[companyname].in.”

---

### 3. Applicability and Accountability  

Every Data Fiduciary, regardless of size or sector, is expected to maintain a **clearly identifiable human point of contact** for matters relating to personal data processing. This requirement applies even if the organisation is not formally mandated to appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** under the Act. In such cases, the organisation must designate a **Responsible Privacy Officer or Representative** to handle privacy-related inquiries and rights requests from Data Principals.  

This individual must have:  
- **Operational awareness** of how personal data is collected, used, stored, and shared across the organisation.  
- **Access authority** to coordinate with IT, legal, or compliance teams to verify facts before responding.  
- **Training** in data-protection principles, incident handling, and communication under DPDPA.  

The person’s role is not merely administrative — they act as the **voice of accountability** for the organisation’s data practices. When a Data Principal submits a query (e.g., “Where is my data stored?” or “Why do you retain this document?”), the contact person must be able to respond accurately, referencing lawful grounds and retention policies.  

For **large or cross-border Data Fiduciaries**, a formally appointed **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** becomes mandatory. The DPO functions as the **single point of contact** between the organisation, Data Principals, and the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)**.  

This ensures a consistent channel for:  
- Responding to user inquiries about processing;  
- Handling regulatory notices, breach communications, or investigation requests; and  
- Submitting compliance reports or audit responses.  

In multinational contexts, where processing occurs both in India and overseas, the DPO should be located in India or have an authorised local representative reachable within Indian jurisdiction. The contact details of this person must be identical across all user-facing platforms, privacy notices, and filings to avoid confusion or perceived opacity.  

Effective accountability means that users always know **who is responsible** and regulators can **reach the right person** quickly — reinforcing the DPDPA’s focus on transparency and trust.

### 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid  

- Publishing a **generic helpdesk email** with no specific privacy function.  
- Providing contact information that is inactive or unmonitored.  
- Using **non-business emails (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo)** — official domain-based addresses are required.  
- Failing to include the contact details in written responses to data-rights requests.  

Each of these practices weakens accountability and may be deemed non-compliance during audits.

### Summary

By mandating public, accessible, and responsive privacy contact information, it ensures that Data Principals always know **who to reach** and that the organisation’s accountability is not just theoretical, but practical and verifiable.
