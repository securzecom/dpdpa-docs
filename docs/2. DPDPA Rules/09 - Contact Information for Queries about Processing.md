# Rule 9: Contact Information for Queries about Processing

Rule 9 ensures that individuals always know whom to contact if they have questions or concerns about how their personal data is being used. Transparency is not just about publishing a notice; it also requires giving people a clear channel of communication.

---

**Under this rule:**

- Every **Data Fiduciary** must provide the **name and contact details** of the person who can answer queries related to data processing.  
- If the organization has appointed a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**, then the DPO’s contact details must be included.  
- If no DPO has been appointed, the contact details of another responsible officer or the **Grievance Officer** must be provided.  
- The information must be displayed in an **easily accessible manner**, such as on the company’s website, mobile application, or in the privacy notice.  

:::danger Critical Point
Without providing accessible contact details, individuals have no way to exercise their rights effectively — making this obligation a cornerstone of compliance.

**Example Scenarios**

:::info Example 1  
A crypto trading platform like **ABC Exchange** must publish the email address and phone number of its DPO so that a trader named **Govind** can ask whether his KYC details are being shared with third parties.  
:::

:::info Example 2
A social media platform like **XYZ Connect** must allow users such as **Krishna** to easily reach its **grievance officer** through the app if they want their old posts or personal details erased.  
:::

:::info Example 3
If a user continues receiving **marketing emails after opting out**, XYZ Travel Services should provide an easy way to submit a complaint, acknowledge it promptly, investigate the cause, correct the system error, and **notify the user once the issue is resolved**.

The intent of **Rule 9** is to remove barriers between individuals and organizations. Instead of leaving people confused about where to complain, the law mandates a **direct and accountable point of contact**. This not only improves **user trust** but also helps organizations respond to concerns before they escalate into **regulatory complaints**.
