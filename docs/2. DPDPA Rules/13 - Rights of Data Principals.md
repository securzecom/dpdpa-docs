# Rule 13: Rights of Data Principals (Operational Details)

Rule 13 explains how the rights of individuals, known as **Data Principals**, are to be exercised in practice. While the Act already grants these rights, the Rule provides clarity on the process and obligations of organizations when such requests are made.

---

**Under this rule:**

- A **Data Principal** may submit a request to **access, correct, erase, or withdraw consent** relating to their personal data. The request must be submitted to the **Data Fiduciary** through the channels specified in the notice or grievance redressal system.  
- The **Data Fiduciary** is required to **acknowledge the request** and act upon it within the time limits prescribed by the Act or Rules.  
- If the Data Fiduciary **rejects a request**, it must provide a **clear explanation** of the reasons for such rejection.  
- The Data Fiduciary must ensure that the process for submitting and tracking requests is **simple and accessible**, and not designed to discourage individuals from exercising their rights.  
- **Records of requests** received and actions taken must be maintained to demonstrate compliance in the event of an **audit or inquiry** by the **Data Protection Board**.  

:::danger Critical Point
The process for exercising rights must always be **simple, accessible, and fair**. Complex or discouraging procedures would amount to non-compliance.
