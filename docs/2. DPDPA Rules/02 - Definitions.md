- **Act** means the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**.  
- **Board** refers to the **Data Protection Board of India** established under the Act.  
- **Consent Manager** means an entity registered with the Board that enables **Data Principals** to give, manage, review, and withdraw their consent in a transparent manner.  
- **Grievance Officer** refers to the person appointed by a **Data Fiduciary** to address complaints from Data Principals.  
- **Significant Data Fiduciary** means a Data Fiduciary notified as such by the Central Government on the basis of factors such as the volume and sensitivity of data processed, risks of harm to Data Principals, or impact on sovereignty and integrity of India.  
- **Schedule** refers to the schedules annexed to the Rules, which form an integral part of them.
