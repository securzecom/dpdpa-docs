# Rule 2: Definitions

<details>
  <summary><strong>Statutory Text — Rule 2: Definitions.</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

2. Definitions.—Unless the context otherwise requires, all expressions shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (22 of 2023) (hereinafter referred to as “Act”).
</details>

---

This rule establishes that all key terms and expressions used in the **Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025** carry the same meanings as defined under the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**.  
It ensures uniform interpretation between the Act and the Rules, preventing inconsistencies in how words like *Data Fiduciary*, *Data Principal*, *Consent Manager*, and *Data Protection Board* are understood and applied.  

In simple terms, this rule acts as a reference point — it tells us that whenever these Rules mention any defined term, we must look to the **Act of 2023** for its official meaning.  
This alignment is crucial for implementation, compliance, and enforcement since both the Act and the Rules together form the complete data-protection framework.

### Key Definitions and Their Meaning  

| **Term / Role** | **Definition (as per the Act)** | **Explanation and Practical Understanding** |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Data Principal** | The individual to whom the personal data relates. | This refers to any person whose data is collected, processed, or stored. For example, a customer opening a bank account, a patient visiting a hospital, or a user signing up for a social media platform. The rights under the Act—such as access, correction, and withdrawal of consent—belong to the Data Principal. |
| **Data Fiduciary** | Any person, company, or government body that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. | The Data Fiduciary is the main entity responsible for how data is used. For example, a bank, hospital, or e-commerce platform acts as the Data Fiduciary for its customers’ data. It must ensure compliance, security, and transparency. |
| **Data Processor** | Any person or organisation that processes personal data on behalf of a Data Fiduciary. | Processors handle data as per the instructions of the Data Fiduciary. For example, a cloud service provider, payment gateway, or outsourced analytics firm processing customer data falls under this role. The processor has limited responsibilities but must maintain safeguards and confidentiality. |
| **Consent Manager** | An entity registered with the Data Protection Board that enables Data Principals to manage, grant, withdraw, or review their consent easily and securely. | Consent Managers serve as intermediaries to make consent management user-friendly. For example, a fintech aggregator or digital consent dashboard allowing users to manage all data permissions from one place. |
| **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** | The independent body established under the Act to monitor compliance, inquire into breaches, and impose penalties. | The Board functions as the enforcement authority—similar to regulators in other sectors. It can investigate data breaches, summon information, and direct corrective measures or fines. |
| **Personal Data** | Any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data. | This includes any information that can identify a person—directly or indirectly—such as name, Aadhaar number, phone number, email, financial records, or biometric data. For example, even a customer ID linked to a mobile number qualifies as personal data. |
| **Processing** | Any operation performed on personal data such as collection, storage, use, sharing, or deletion. | It covers all actions taken on data throughout its lifecycle. For example, collecting KYC details, storing them in a CRM, or deleting inactive user accounts all count as processing. |
| **Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)** | A Data Fiduciary classified as “significant” by the Central Government based on factors like data volume, sensitivity, or risk to individuals. | Large organisations or those processing sensitive or large-scale data—such as banks, social media platforms, or healthcare providers—may be designated as SDFs. They have extra obligations such as Data Protection Impact Assessments and audits. |
| **Breach of Personal Data** | Any unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or loss of personal data that compromises its confidentiality, integrity, or availability. | This includes accidental data leaks, hacking incidents, insider misuse, or improper disposal of data. For instance, a leaked customer database or stolen backup drive qualifies as a breach. |
| **Child** | An individual who has not completed 18 years of age. | Any online service collecting data from users under 18 must obtain verifiable parental consent and provide safeguards against profiling or targeted advertising. |
| **Person with Disability and Lawful Guardian** | A person with disability whose personal data may be managed through a lawful guardian as defined under applicable laws. | Organisations handling data of individuals with disabilities must ensure that consent and rights are exercised through their authorised guardian in a verifiable and secure manner. |
| **Data Principal’s Rights** | Rights granted to individuals such as access, correction, erasure, grievance redressal, and consent withdrawal. | These empower individuals to control their personal data. For example, a user can request deletion of old data or correct incorrect records in an online profile. |
| **Obligations of Data Fiduciary** | Duties imposed on data fiduciaries such as implementing security safeguards, minimising data collection, and ensuring accuracy. | Every Data Fiduciary must protect personal data, use it only for stated purposes, and comply with all rules and notifications issued by the government. |

Rule 2 ensures that both the **Act and the Rules speak the same language**. It avoids duplication and legal ambiguity.  
For compliance teams, this means every time a term appears in these Rules—such as *Data Fiduciary*, *Processor*, or *Consent Manager*—its meaning must be interpreted exactly as it is defined in the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023*.  

In practice, this rule acts as the **foundation for consistent implementation**. Whether in banking, healthcare, Web3, or manufacturing, it ensures that every stakeholder uses a shared understanding of the key roles and responsibilities, reducing confusion and improving regulatory clarity.
