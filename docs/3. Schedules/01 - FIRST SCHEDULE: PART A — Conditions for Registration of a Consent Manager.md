### 1. The applicant must be a company incorporated in India  

This ensures jurisdictional accountability — only companies governed by Indian law can operate as Consent Managers. It allows the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** to enforce compliance and oversight directly under Indian regulations.  

:::info Example  
A fintech startup registered under the Companies Act, 2013 in Bengaluru may apply to become a Consent Manager. However, a foreign company or offshore entity cannot be directly registered — it must first incorporate in India.  
:::

### 2. The applicant must have sufficient technical, operational, and financial capacity  

The company must demonstrate it has the **infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources** to securely manage and process consent requests at scale. This includes:  
- Robust IT infrastructure for authentication, encryption, and data management.  
- Skilled staff in cybersecurity, compliance, and legal operations.  
- Sustainable financial health to maintain services long-term.  

:::tip  
The DPBI may review infrastructure capacity (servers, APIs, uptime metrics) and compliance certifications such as ISO 27001 or SOC-2 to verify capability.  
:::

### 3. The financial condition and management integrity must be sound  

The company’s **balance sheet, governance structure, and leadership background** must reflect financial stability and good ethical standing. The government wants to ensure that consent managers are not shell companies, bankrupt entities, or run by individuals with questionable records.  

:::info Example  
A company with pending fraud litigation or unstable finances would likely fail this criterion. Similarly, companies under insolvency proceedings cannot qualify.  
:::

---

### 4. The net worth must be at least ₹2 crore  

This rule sets a **minimum capital requirement** to ensure only financially strong and credible players operate as Consent Managers. A higher net worth threshold ensures operational continuity, consumer trust, and the ability to absorb risks such as data breaches or infrastructure upgrades.  

:::tip  
Net worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities (as per books of accounts).  
The threshold ensures the company can afford secure infrastructure, compliance audits, and liability coverage.  
:::

---

### 5. The business volume, capital structure, and earning prospects must be adequate  

The applicant must have a sustainable **business model** and long-term viability. The DPBI evaluates whether the company can maintain services without compromising privacy obligations for commercial reasons.  

:::info Example  
A newly formed company projecting revenue only from data brokerage or ad targeting would not be considered appropriate.  
However, a data-governance service provider with recurring institutional clients could qualify.  
:::

---

### 6. The management must have a reputation for fairness and integrity  

The directors, key managerial personnel (KMPs), and senior managers should be individuals with a clean professional track record and a reputation for ethical behavior. This prevents entities led by persons previously involved in data-misuse or compliance violations from being approved.  

---

### 7. Corporate documents must include adherence clauses  

The **Memorandum and Articles of Association (MoA & AoA)** of the company must contain clauses ensuring:  
- Compliance with obligations listed in Part B (items 9 & 10) — mainly conflict-of-interest prevention.  
- Policies and procedures to enforce such compliance.  
- Amendments to these clauses require prior **Board approval**.  

This ensures privacy obligations are embedded into the company’s core governance, not added as optional policies.  

:::info Example  
Before changing its business scope or governance clauses, a Consent Manager must first obtain written approval from the DPBI, ensuring transparency and accountability.  
:::

---

### 8. Operations must serve the interests of Data Principals  

Every activity of a Consent Manager must prioritise **user benefit** — not profit or data monetisation. The Consent Manager acts in a **fiduciary capacity**, meaning it must act in the best interest of the individual.  

:::tip  
DPDPA Section 4 and Rule 6 reinforce this fiduciary duty — Consent Managers must enable privacy rights, not commercial exploitation.  
:::

---

### 9. Independent certification of technology and compliance  

A third-party auditor must verify that:  

(a) The company’s consent platform is **interoperable** and follows data protection standards published by the DPBI.  
(b) Adequate **technical and organisational controls** (like encryption, authentication, monitoring) are implemented.  

This certification ensures consistent security and interoperability among different Consent Managers.  

:::info Example  
A Consent Manager’s system must allow users to manage consents from multiple data fiduciaries (like banks or hospitals) through a single interface — similar to how UPI works across banks.
