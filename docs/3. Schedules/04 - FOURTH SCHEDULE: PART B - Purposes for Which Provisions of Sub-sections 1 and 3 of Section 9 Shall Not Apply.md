This section specifies circumstances where certain restrictions under **Section 9(1)** and **Section 9(3)** of the DPDPA — which generally limit processing of children’s personal data — **do not apply**, provided that processing remains strictly necessary, proportionate, and protective in nature. The intent is to ensure essential services, legal duties, and child safety measures continue smoothly while upholding privacy safeguards.

---

### 1. Legal and Governmental Functions  

When authorities or institutions act under a law to protect a child’s welfare, such as social services, child protection units, or juvenile boards, they may process data without requiring consent, but only **to the extent necessary for lawful discharge of duties**.  

This ensures that government and authorised bodies can respond to cases involving child abuse, neglect, or medical emergencies promptly and lawfully.

:::info Example  
A child welfare officer may collect and share personal details of a minor during a rescue operation or legal inquiry under the Juvenile Justice Act. The exemption allows such necessary data handling while ensuring it does not extend to unrelated purposes like profiling or public disclosure.  
:::

---

### 2. Delivery of Subsidies, Benefits, and Public Services  

Government agencies and institutions may process a child’s data when issuing **subsidies, scholarships, healthcare coverage, digital certificates, or public benefits**. The exemption applies only where such processing is essential for providing these services or verifying eligibility.

This clause aligns with **Section 7(b)** of the DPDPA, which recognises processing “in the interests of the Data Principal” when public funds or legal entitlements are involved.

:::info Example  
A state education department may collect children’s personal data to disburse mid-day meal benefits or provide free digital learning devices under a welfare scheme. This processing is lawful under this Schedule.  
:::

---

### 3. Creation of Child Email Accounts  

Certain educational or communication services may create user accounts for children that allow only **email-based interactions** — often for academic or official communication. Such processing must be strictly confined to account creation and maintenance; the email system cannot be used for behavioural tracking, advertising, or profiling.

:::tip  
Schools or learning platforms offering institutional email IDs (e.g., studentname@school.edu) for correspondence with teachers and administrators may do so under this exemption, provided no commercial use of the account occurs.  
:::

---

### 4. Protecting Children from Harmful or Inappropriate Content  

Data Fiduciaries can process necessary information to **filter, restrict, or block access** to online content that may harm a child’s psychological or emotional well-being. This exemption allows digital service providers, app developers, and educational portals to apply **content moderation or parental controls** responsibly.

The processing must remain **limited to safeguarding functions** and should not involve collecting unrelated data about browsing behaviour or preferences.

:::info Example  
A video streaming platform may use age-based filters to prevent children from accessing adult or violent content. The platform can process limited age-related data to apply restrictions, but cannot use it for targeted advertisements.  
:::

---

### 5. Age Verification and Compliance with Rule 10  

Before collecting or processing data, a Data Fiduciary must verify whether a user is a child (below 18 years) and perform due diligence as specified in **Rule 10**. This may involve requesting minimal personal details or using third-party verification systems. The exemption permits such data use strictly for confirming age and compliance obligations.

Once verification is complete, unnecessary information should be securely deleted.

:::tip  
For example, an online gaming company may request a user’s date of birth or ID proof to confirm age eligibility. After verification, it must retain only essential metadata confirming compliance and discard sensitive identifiers.  
:::

---

### 6. Legal and Ethical Boundary of the Exemption  

Although the above purposes are exempted from Section 9(1) and (3), all entities remain accountable under the Act for:  
- Ensuring **data minimisation** — collecting only what is necessary;  
- Maintaining **reasonable security safeguards**;  
- Avoiding any **secondary use** of children’s data; and  
- Providing **clear notices** where practicable.  

The exemptions are **functional, not absolute** — they exist to enable lawful and welfare-driven actions, not to dilute privacy obligations.

---

### 7. Key Takeaways for Compliance  

To implement these provisions responsibly, Data Fiduciaries should:  
1. Clearly document the **purpose and lawful basis** for every child-data processing activity.  
2. Conduct **risk and impact assessments** when systems handle sensitive child data.  
3. Limit access to **authorised personnel** and ensure all data exchanges are secure.  
4. Establish **retention limits** consistent with necessity and proportionality.  
5. Maintain an **audit trail** for accountability during oversight or inspection.  

---
The Fourth Schedule (Part B) creates a structured framework for limited, welfare-oriented processing of children’s data by lawful entities. It ensures that data handling necessary for **healthcare, education, welfare, or safety** is not hindered by procedural barriers, while preserving India’s commitment to children’s digital dignity and privacy. By tying each exemption to necessity and proportionality, this Schedule maintains the spirit of the DPDPA — enabling responsible innovation and governance while keeping child safety at the core.
