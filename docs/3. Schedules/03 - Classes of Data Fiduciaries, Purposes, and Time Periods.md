# Schedule III: Classes of Data Fiduciaries, Purposes, and Time Periods

Schedule III provides a structured framework that links three key aspects of data processing:  

1. **Which class of Data Fiduciaries** is involved.  
2. **What purpose** they may process personal data for.  
3. **How long** the data may be retained before it must be deleted or anonymised.  

This schedule is important because it prevents organizations from **storing personal data indefinitely**. It enforces the principle that data should only be retained as long as it serves a **lawful purpose**.

## What the Schedule Covers

### Classes of Data Fiduciaries
Data Fiduciaries are grouped by type of industry or activity (e.g., **banking, insurance, e-commerce, healthcare, social media**).  

### Specified Purposes
The purposes are clearly defined, such as processing for **account opening, delivery of goods, claim settlement, payroll management, or regulatory reporting**.  

### Time Periods
For each purpose, a **maximum retention period** is prescribed. Once that period ends, the personal data must either be **deleted or anonymised**, unless retention is **legally mandated**.  

:::danger Critical Point
Schedule III makes it clear: **no indefinite retention of personal data is allowed**. Once the lawful purpose ends, the data must be deleted or irreversibly anonymised.

## Example Scenarios Across Industries

:::info Banking  
A bank may collect **customer identity documents (PAN, Aadhaar, passport)** for account opening and KYC verification. These documents may only be retained for the time prescribed under financial regulations (e.g., **10 years after account closure**). After that period, the bank must either **delete or anonymise** the data.  
:::

:::info Insurance  
An **insurance company** may process **medical reports** for claim settlement. Once the claim is settled and the legally required retention period is over, the reports must be **erased**. Keeping them forever for “future reference” is not permitted.  
:::

:::info E-Commerce  
An **online retailer** may store **delivery addresses and order history** to fulfil purchases and handle returns. After the return period expires and there is no active customer relationship, these details must be **purged**, unless the customer explicitly chooses to save them.  
:::

:::info Pharmaceuticals  
A **drug manufacturer** conducting a **clinical trial** may retain **health data of participants** for the duration of the trial and reporting obligations. After that, the data must be **anonymised** so that no participant can be individually identified.  
:::

:::info Social Media  
A **platform** may collect **photos, messages, and profile information** for account operation. If a user deletes the account, the platform must **remove all linked data** after the retention window for grievance or legal requirements ends.

## Importance of Schedule III

Without strict retention limits, organizations tend to **hoard personal data indefinitely**. This increases the risk of massive **breaches and misuse**.  

Schedule III enforces **discipline and proportionality**: data should serve a purpose, and once that purpose ends, the data should no longer exist in identifiable form.  

It also gives **individuals predictability** — for example, if you close your bank account or insurance policy, you know how long your information will be retained before it is erased.
