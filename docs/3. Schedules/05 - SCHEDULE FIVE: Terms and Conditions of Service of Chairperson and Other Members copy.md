The Fifth Schedule of the Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, outlines the service conditions, remuneration, and professional conduct requirements for the Chairperson and Members of the Data Protection Board of India. It establishes a transparent and uniform framework ensuring independence, accountability, and ethical integrity of the Board.

**Remuneration:** The Chairperson receives a fixed salary of ₹4.5 lakh per month, and Members ₹4 lakh per month — both without house or car facilities. This consolidated pay model eliminates discretionary perks and upholds impartiality.

**Benefits and Allowances:** Members are entitled to provident fund contributions and travel, leave, and medical benefits equivalent to senior Central Government officers (Level 17 for Chairperson, Level 15 for Members). However, no pension, gratuity, sitting fee, or sumptuary allowance is provided.

**Governance and Conduct:** All office bearers must maintain conflict-free service, adhere to Central Civil Services (CCA and Leave) Rules, and operate with transparency and fairness. Any unresolved condition defaults to the Central Government’s decision, which is final.

**Policy Objective:** The Schedule ensures that the Board functions with administrative autonomy but under disciplined public accountability. By aligning its structure with Group-A service norms, it attracts competent experts while preserving public trust in data protection enforcement.

### 2. Provident Fund
Both the Chairperson and Members are eligible to contribute to the **Provident Fund** of the Board, under the same rules that apply to other officers and employees of the Board. This creates parity within the organisation and ensures continuity of retirement savings during their tenure.

### 3. Pension and Gratuity

These provisions align the Board’s travel entitlements with established Central Government norms to maintain accountability in public expenditure.

5. Any service-condition matter not expressly covered will be referred to the **Central Government**, whose decision will be final.

These clauses reinforce the ethical, non-commercial nature of Board service and centralise oversight with the Government to ensure uniform standards.

### 9. Definition of Pay Matrix
The term **“pay matrix”** refers to the structure published in the Government Resolution No. 1-2/2016-IC, dated 25 July 2016, which outlines pay levels and corresponding entitlements for Central Government officers.

This ensures consistent reference points for calculating allowances and benefits across all schedules.

The Fifth Schedule formalises a transparent compensation and service-condition framework for the **Chairperson and Members of the Data Protection Board of India**.  
Its design ensures that these roles attract competent professionals while maintaining the Board’s independence from administrative or political influence.

1. **Fixed remuneration** prevents financial dependency on discretionary allowances.  
2. **No pension or gratuity** highlights limited-term functional accountability.  
3. **Standardised benefits**—travel, health, leave, and LTC—align with senior-level government parity.  
4. **Conflict-of-interest provisions** uphold impartiality in adjudication and enforcement.  
5. **Central Government oversight** guarantees uniform interpretation of grey areas.

Overall, the Schedule ensures that service on the Data Protection Board is viewed as a **public trust position**, governed by integrity, fairness, and fiscal discipline rather than privilege or profit.
