# Schedule I: Consent Manager

Schedule I of the **Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025** is devoted entirely to **Consent Managers**, an essential innovation of the DPDPA framework. The Schedule is divided into two parts:  

- **Part A** – Conditions for Registration of a Consent Manager.  
- **Part B** – Obligations of a Consent Manager after registration.  

Together, they ensure that only **competent, trustworthy, and secure entities** can act as Consent Managers, and that once registered, they remain **accountable** to both **Data Principals (individuals)** and the **Data Protection Board**.

If a **hospital chain** uses a Consent Manager to manage patient consents for sharing medical data with research labs, the Consent Manager must ensure the data **cannot be intercepted or altered** by attackers.  
:::

## Importance of Consent Managers

The idea of **Consent Managers** is **unique to India’s data protection model**. Instead of leaving individuals to struggle with dozens of different privacy settings across various platforms, a single Consent Manager can act as a **trusted hub** for all consent-related activities.  

- For **individuals**, it means **real control**: one platform to check, grant, or withdraw consent across **banks, insurers, e-commerce sites, healthcare providers, and more**.  
- For **organizations**, it creates **standardization and accountability**, ensuring that consents are **captured and stored in a legally valid way**.  
- For **regulators**, it provides a **clear audit trail**, making **enforcement much easier**.
