The Fourth Schedule identifies specific categories of organisations and professionals who process children’s personal data **for limited, protective purposes**, and therefore receive conditional exemption from certain provisions of Section 9 of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA).  

This exemption recognises that certain activities — such as medical care, education, or child safety — require the use of minors’ data under strict professional responsibility and safeguards. The focus remains on necessity, proportionality, and protection.

### 1. Clinical, Mental-Health, and Healthcare Professionals  

Entities in the medical and mental-health domains may process a child’s personal data **only to the extent necessary** for providing healthcare services and ensuring well-being. This includes hospitals, paediatric clinics, therapists, counsellors, and registered healthcare practitioners.  

The exemption enables timely medical treatment and emergency response without procedural delays in obtaining explicit parental consent for every act of data processing.

:::info Example  
If a paediatric hospital needs to record a child’s medical history, vaccination status, or diagnostic results during treatment, it may process this information for clinical purposes. However, it cannot reuse the data for research or commercial analytics unless fresh consent is obtained.  
:::

---

### 2. Allied Healthcare Professionals  

This category covers physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, or rehabilitation specialists who support primary medical practitioners. They may process personal data related to a child’s health **solely for implementing or referring to treatment plans** and only as much as is essential for safeguarding health.  

The rule ensures smooth coordination among healthcare providers while maintaining confidentiality.

:::tip  
Allied professionals should limit shared information to treatment-relevant details — for example, sharing dietary instructions or physiotherapy schedules — and avoid retaining full medical histories unless required.  
:::

### 3. Educational Institutions  

Schools, colleges, and other educational bodies may process children’s data for **tracking or behavioural monitoring** strictly within two contexts:  
1. For academic and administrative purposes directly linked to education, or  
2. For maintaining the safety and security of enrolled students.  

This provision enables educational institutions to use attendance systems, learning-analytics platforms, and security tools responsibly while avoiding misuse of children’s personal information.

:::info Example  
A school may monitor attendance through smart ID cards or digital attendance software, and track students during school trips for safety. It may not, however, share this data with advertisers or third-party tutoring apps.  
:::

---

### 4. Child-Care and Day-Care Providers  

Individuals or institutions that operate crèches or day-care centres may process personal data of infants and young children **for safety and welfare monitoring**. The exemption allows them to record attendance, dietary needs, or emergency contacts to ensure proper care during the day.  

Data handling must still respect privacy principles and should not extend to non-essential profiling or disclosure.

:::tip  
A child-care provider may log a child’s daily arrival, pick-up times, and health observations, but cannot share this information publicly or with unauthorised persons.  
:::

---

### 5. Transport Service Providers for Educational or Child-Care Institutions  

Transport services, such as school bus operators or authorised logistics partners, may collect and process location data of children **exclusively for ensuring safe travel** between home and the institution. This exemption enables real-time tracking and parental notifications while maintaining confidentiality and purpose limitation.  

Once travel is completed, location data should not be retained beyond what is necessary for safety verification or incident response.

:::info Example  
A school transport operator may use GPS to inform parents when a bus reaches the school or a designated stop. However, retaining that movement data for months or sharing it with unrelated third parties would violate the proportionality principle.  
:::

---

### 6. Significance of the Exemption  

These exemptions balance two equally important objectives —  
1. **Protecting children’s safety, health, and education**, and  
2. **Preventing over-collection or misuse** of minors’ personal data.  

All exempted entities must still follow the broader obligations of the DPDPA, such as ensuring data security, restricting access to authorised personnel, and maintaining audit trails.

---

### 7. Compliance Recommendations  

To remain compliant under this Schedule, organisations and individuals should:  
- Maintain clear **records of purpose and necessity** for each instance of data processing.  
- Adopt strong **data security and access controls**, especially where digital systems are used.  
- Train staff on **ethical handling of children’s information**.  
- Regularly **review retention periods** and delete data once its purpose is fulfilled.  
- Provide **transparency notices** to parents or guardians, explaining how and why children’s data is used.  

---

The Fourth Schedule (Part A) establishes a framework of **controlled exemptions** for institutions and professionals entrusted with the care, education, and health of children.  
It allows essential processing of minors’ data under conditions of necessity and safety, while upholding accountability, transparency, and respect for privacy.  

These measures reinforce the DPDPA’s principle that data protection must coexist with the protection of life, health, and security - especially for the country’s youngest citizens.
