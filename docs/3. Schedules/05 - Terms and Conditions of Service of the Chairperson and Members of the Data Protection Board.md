# Schedule V: Terms and Conditions of Service of the Chairperson and Members of the Data Protection Board

Schedule V provides detailed rules governing the **service conditions** of the **Chairperson and Members** of the **Data Protection Board of India**. Since these individuals are central to the enforcement of the DPDPA, their **independence, integrity, and impartiality** must be safeguarded through well-defined service conditions.

## Key Provisions

### Tenure and Appointment
The Chairperson and Members are appointed by the **Central Government** for a **fixed term** as prescribed. Their continuation is not dependent on the will of private parties or external influence, ensuring **institutional stability**.

### Salary and Allowances
Their **salaries, allowances, leave entitlements, and retirement benefits** are explicitly determined by the **Central Government**. This clarity prevents disputes and ensures **fair compensation** that matches the gravity of their responsibilities.

### Service Conditions
Apart from pay, the rules cover service conditions such as **working hours, official privileges, use of facilities, and grounds for removal or suspension**.

### Code of Conduct and Restrictions
Members must adhere to standards of **professional conduct** and are often barred from taking up **conflicting employment or business** during their tenure. This restriction preserves **impartiality**.

:::danger Critical Point
The independence of the Board depends on **secure, transparent, and stable service conditions**. Without these, Members could be vulnerable to **external pressure or conflicts of interest**.

## Why It Matters

The Data Protection Board is empowered to:  
- Impose penalties of up to **₹250 crore**  
- Order companies to **stop data processing**  
- Require **corrective measures**  

These decisions may affect powerful stakeholders, including **multinational corporations, financial institutions, and government bodies**.  

If the Chairperson or Members lacked secure service conditions, their independence could be compromised. **Schedule V prevents this** by ensuring that compensation and terms of service are **stable, transparent, and protected** from outside pressure.

## Example Scenarios

:::info Example 1  
If the Board imposes a penalty of **₹150 crore** on a global **social media platform** for mishandling children’s data, the fairness of that decision depends heavily on the Members being **financially independent and professionally secure**.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
If a large **pharmaceutical company** challenges a Board order, the credibility of the enforcement action rests on the perception that the **Chairperson and Members are impartial**, not swayed by inducements or insecurity about their positions.

**Schedule V** strengthens the **institutional credibility** of the Data Protection Board. By defining service conditions in advance, it eliminates doubts about **bias or vulnerability to influence**.  

This, in turn, builds **trust** among individuals, businesses, and international stakeholders that India’s privacy regulator will act **fairly, consistently, and independently**.
