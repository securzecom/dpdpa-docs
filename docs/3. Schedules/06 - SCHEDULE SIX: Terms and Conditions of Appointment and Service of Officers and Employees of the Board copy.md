The Sixth Schedule defines the service framework for officers and employees of the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI). It outlines their appointment process, employment terms, benefits, and disciplinary standards, aligning them with the Central Civil Services Rules to ensure transparency, consistency, and accountability. While most staff are appointed on deputation from government or public institutions, the Schedule also allows the Board to engage professionals from the National Institute for Smart Government (NISG) on market-linked terms — ensuring access to specialized digital and technical expertise required for enforcing the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

### 1. Classes of Officials  

This clause empowers the **Board** to recruit its workforce primarily through **deputation**, in accordance with the **Fundamental Rules (FRs)** and **DoPT guidelines**. Deputation ensures that experienced officers from Central or State Governments, statutory bodies, or public sector enterprises can be temporarily assigned to the Board without severing their parent-cadre link.  

- Deputation is limited to **five years**, balancing continuity with periodic rotation of talent.  
- The Board can draw officers from diverse institutions, such as ministries, regulatory authorities, or national agencies, ensuring a blend of administrative, legal, and technical expertise.  

In addition, the rule expressly allows the Board to source professionals from the **National Institute for Smart Government (NISG)** — an organisation known for implementing digital governance projects. This provision acknowledges the **techno-legal nature** of the Board’s mandate and enables it to engage market-competitive professionals for cybersecurity, data analytics, and privacy operations. Salary and allowances for such personnel may be aligned with **market benchmarks**, providing flexibility beyond rigid government pay scales.

:::info Example  
If the Board needs a cybersecurity expert or IT architect for its case-management system, it can take an NISG professional on deputation for up to five years, paying compensation aligned with private-sector norms while maintaining policy oversight.

### 2. Gratuity  

All officers and employees are entitled to gratuity under the **Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972**. This ensures financial security upon separation or retirement, similar to other public-sector employees. The inclusion of this clause aligns the Board’s HR framework with broader labour welfare standards, reinforcing its credibility as a statutory employer.

---

### 3. Travelling Allowance  

Travel entitlements of the Board’s officers mirror those applicable to equivalent Central Government officials. The phrase *mutatis mutandis* implies that the same rules — regarding daily allowance, reimbursement, and travel class — apply with necessary modifications.  

This ensures consistency, reduces administrative ambiguity, and prevents misuse of discretionary travel claims. It also allows the Board to participate effectively in on-site audits, investigations, or hearings across India.

:::info Example  
If a Deputy Director of the Board travels for an inspection at a data-centre in Hyderabad, her travel allowance, hotel entitlement, and per diem will follow the same schedule as a Deputy Secretary in the Central Government.  
:::

---

### 4. Medical Assistance  

The Board must provide medical coverage for its officers, employees, and their dependants under a **group health insurance scheme**, approved by the Central Government.  

This replaces the traditional CGHS model with a modern corporate-style group insurance approach, enabling faster claim settlements and broader hospital networks. The scheme strengthens staff welfare and ensures uninterrupted healthcare support for personnel engaged in demanding regulatory work.

---

### 5. Leave Entitlements  

Leave benefits under this Schedule replicate those in the **Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972**, ensuring parity with Government service.  

- Officers can avail **earned leave, half-pay leave, commuted leave, and extraordinary leave**, subject to the same conditions as Government servants.  
- **Encashment of earned leave** is permitted, maintaining financial equity with equivalent cadres.  
- **Casual leave** follows Central Government norms.

By adopting standard rules, the Board simplifies HR administration and maintains inter-departmental mobility for deputed officers.

:::tip  
When a technical officer from the Ministry of Electronics and IT is deputed to the Board, her accumulated leave balance remains portable, avoiding any break in service benefits.  
:::

---

### 6. Leave Travel Concession (LTC)  

Officers and employees appointed on deputation under Clause (1) are eligible for **LTC** as per the **Central Civil Services (Leave Travel Concession) Rules, 1988**. This provision ensures that officials can avail **home-town or all-India travel concessions**, similar to their counterparts in Central Government service.

It promotes work-life balance and morale while maintaining administrative uniformity across deputed staff.

---

### 7. Other Terms and Conditions of Service  

This section anchors the **ethical, disciplinary, and procedural standards** applicable to the Board’s staff:  

- **Conduct Rules:** Officers must comply with the **Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964**, covering integrity, impartiality, and avoidance of conflict of interest.  
- **Disciplinary Control:** Provisions from **Parts IV to IX of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965** apply *mutatis mutandis*. These cover procedures for misconduct inquiries, suspension, penalties, and appeals.  
- **Residual Authority:** Any service matter not expressly covered under this Schedule shall be decided by the **Central Government**, whose decision is final.

This ensures strong governance oversight, preventing inconsistent HR decisions or local administrative discretion. It also reinforces the Board’s role as a **statutory body under executive control**, not an autonomous corporate entity.

:::info Example  
If an officer violates confidentiality norms or mishandles case data, disciplinary action will proceed under CCS (CCA) Rules, with the Central Government serving as the final appellate authority.  
:::

---

### Policy Significance  

The Sixth Schedule embodies a **dual governance model** — operational autonomy for efficiency and procedural alignment with the Central Government for integrity. It balances **public accountability** with the flexibility to engage external specialists.  

By importing proven frameworks from the civil service system while enabling market-based hiring through NISG, the Schedule ensures that the Board can attract multidisciplinary expertise — legal, technical, and managerial — essential for enforcing India’s data-protection regime.  

Moreover, by clearly defining entitlements and disciplinary procedures, it prevents administrative ambiguity and ensures a transparent, consistent approach across all staff levels.

---

The Sixth Schedule builds the **institutional backbone** of the Data Protection Board of India.  
It ensures that every officer, from senior regulatory staff to technical analysts, operates under clearly defined **service, welfare, and ethical parameters**, harmonised with national civil-service standards.  

In essence, this Schedule transforms the Board from a theoretical authority into a **functionally governed institution** — disciplined, credible, and equipped to execute its data-protection mandate with professionalism and accountability.
