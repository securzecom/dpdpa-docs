# Schedule II: Standards for Processing by the State and for Specified Purposes

Schedule II sets the **baseline standards** that must be followed when the **State or its instrumentalities** process personal data. This is especially important because government bodies in India handle vast volumes of **sensitive data** — from Aadhaar numbers and tax records to health data, welfare entitlements, and educational records.  

The Schedule ensures that while the State can process personal data without always requiring consent (for **subsidies, benefits, licences, or permits**), such processing must still be carried out with **safeguards**.

---

Schedule II is divided into two main parts:  
- **Part A** – Processing by the State under Section 7(b) of the Act  
- **Part B** – Processing for specified purposes under Section 17(2)(b) of the Act  

---

## Part A: Standards for Processing by the State (Section 7(b))

When the government processes personal data to deliver **subsidies, services, licences, or permits**, it must follow prescribed standards:

### Purpose Limitation
The processing must be strictly limited to what is necessary for delivering the benefit, service, or authorisation applied for.  

:::info Example  
If **Govind** applies for a driving licence, the transport department may process his **Aadhaar number, address, and biometrics** only for issuing the licence. It cannot use that data later for unrelated profiling.  
:::

### Data Minimisation
Only the **minimum amount of personal data** required to complete the service should be collected and processed.  

:::info Example  
If a farmer named **Narayan** applies for a fertilizer subsidy, the agriculture department should only collect **landholding details and bank account numbers** needed to transfer the benefit, not unrelated data such as educational qualifications.  
:::

### Security Safeguards
The State must apply **reasonable security controls** such as encryption, secure servers, and restricted access to protect personal data against breaches.

### Access and Accountability
Individuals must know **whom to contact** in case they wish to query or challenge how their data is being processed by a government department.

## Part B: Standards for Processing for Specified Purposes (Section 17(2)(b))

The law also permits exemptions for certain specified purposes such as **research, statistical analysis, or archiving**. In such cases, Schedule II sets the guardrails to prevent misuse:

### Anonymisation Wherever Possible
Wherever feasible, data must be **anonymised** so that individuals cannot be directly identified.  

:::info Example  
A health research body studying **cancer prevalence** may process hospital admission data but must anonymise names and addresses so that patients are not identifiable.  
:::

### Strict Prohibition on Secondary Use
Data collected for research or statistical purposes must not be diverted to **commercial exploitation**.  

:::info Example  
If a **manufacturing industry association** collects workforce data to study employment patterns, it cannot later **sell that data** to recruitment companies.  
:::

### Security Obligations Still Apply
Even for exempted purposes, organizations must use **adequate security measures** to prevent leaks or unauthorized access.

### Proportionality of Retention
Data processed for research or archiving must not be kept **longer than necessary** to achieve the legitimate purpose.

:::danger Critical Point
Exemptions under Part B do **not waive security, accountability, or proportionality**. Anonymisation and prevention of secondary misuse are mandatory safeguards.

## Why Schedule II Matters

Government agencies are some of the **largest data handlers** in India. Without proper standards, the risk of misuse, overreach, or breaches would be enormous.  

Schedule II ensures that:  
- Citizens continue to receive **benefits and services** without unnecessary delays caused by repeated consent requirements.  
- The **State** is held to the same standards of **security, accountability, and proportionality** as private companies.  
- Exemptions for **research and statistical purposes** are not abused, and personal privacy is protected even when explicit consent is not sought.

**Example for Context**

:::info Example 1  
When **ABC Insurance Ltd.** applies for a licence to sell policies, the **Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)** may process company details and director information without explicit consent, but only for the purpose of granting or rejecting the licence.  
:::

:::info Example 2  
When the **National Statistical Office (NSO)** conducts a census, it may collect large amounts of household data but must **anonymise it before publishing results**.
