After identifying the gaps, the next step is to create a **data map**. This shows how personal data moves through your organization.  

- **Customer data**: What do you collect from customers (email, phone, address, Aadhaar, payment details)? Where is it stored (**databases, cloud**)? Who has access?  
- **Employee data**: Do you store **resumes, bank details, or medical records**? Who processes them â€” **HR, payroll service providers, insurance partners**?  
- **Vendor data**: What information do you keep about **suppliers or contractors**? Are their details shared with **other third parties**?  

Mapping data flows is critical because **DPDPA compliance requires** that you know exactly **what data you hold, why you hold it, and where it goes**.  

:::info Example  
A **stock broking company** may realize that **customer trade histories** are shared with **third-party analytics vendors abroad**. Under DPDPA, it must now check if such transfers are lawful and if those vendors offer **adequate safeguards**.

:::danger Critical Point
Without accurate **data flow mapping**, organizations cannot ensure **lawfulness, accountability, or security** of personal data. It is the **foundation** for breach response, cross-border compliance, and respecting Data Principal rights.
