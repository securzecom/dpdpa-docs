Once the initial foundation is in place (**gap assessment, data mapping, privacy notices, and appointing officers**), the next step is to create **internal policies**.  

These policies act as a **rulebook** for your organization — guiding **employees, partners, and systems** on how personal data must be handled.  

The **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023** requires that organizations put these policies in place to demonstrate **accountability**.  

---

### 1. Data Retention and Deletion Policy
The DPDPA requires that **personal data must not be stored longer than necessary**. Every organization must define **how long data is kept** and **when it will be erased or anonymised**.  

- Define retention periods for **customer, employee, and vendor data**.  
- Ensure **automatic deletion or anonymisation** after the purpose is served.  
- Document **legal exceptions** (e.g., SEBI rules may require brokers to keep financial data for seven years).  

:::info Example  
A **bank** must retain **KYC records** for **10 years** after account closure under **RBI rules**. After that period, the data must be **securely deleted**.  
:::

### 2. Breach Response and Notification Policy
Under **Rule 7**, organizations must notify the **Data Protection Board** and affected individuals of any breach **within 72 hours**.  

A breach policy ensures the organization knows exactly how to respond.  

- Define what constitutes a **data breach** (unauthorized access, accidental disclosure, ransomware attack).  
- Create a **breach response team** (IT, legal, compliance, communications).  
- Prepare **draft templates** for breach notifications to the Board and customers.  
- Conduct **breach simulation exercises (“fire drills”)**.  

:::info Example  
If an **e-commerce platform** discovers that **50,000 customer credit card records** were leaked, the breach policy ensures it immediately **triggers alerts, investigates, contains the incident, and files a formal notification** to the Board within **72 hours**.

### 3. Information Security Policy
The DPDPA obliges every Data Fiduciary to implement **reasonable security safeguards**. An information security policy documents those safeguards and assigns responsibilities.  

- Password and **access control requirements**.  
- **Encryption** of sensitive data (financial, health, identification numbers).  
- **Employee awareness training** against phishing and insider threats.  
- **Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing**.  

:::info Example  
A **pharmaceutical company** conducting clinical trials must **encrypt patient data**, restrict access to authorized staff, and conduct **regular security testing** to prevent leaks of sensitive health information.  
:::

---

### 4. Consent Management Policy
Consent is the **cornerstone** of the DPDPA. Organizations must have a clear internal process for **capturing, managing, and withdrawing consent**.  

- Define how consent will be collected (**digital forms, app interfaces, Consent Managers**).  
- Ensure **records of consent** are securely stored and retrievable.  
- Set procedures for processing **consent withdrawal requests** quickly.  

:::info Example  
A **social media platform** must have systems in place so that if a user withdraws consent for **targeted advertising**, the platform **stops processing** such data without delay.  
:::

---

### 5. Vendor and Third-Party Data Processing Policy
If personal data is shared with vendors (**cloud providers, payroll companies, logistics partners**), the organization remains **responsible**.  

- Maintain **contracts with data protection clauses** (purpose limitation, security safeguards, liability for breaches).  
- Audit **high-risk vendors** periodically.  
- Keep **records of data shared** with each vendor.  

:::info Example  
A **crypto exchange** outsourcing **KYC verification** to a third-party service provider must ensure that the vendor applies the same **security and privacy standards** required under the DPDPA.  
:::

## Why Internal Policies Are Critical

These policies create a **culture of compliance**.  

They also serve as **evidence** during **audits or investigations** that the organization has taken **reasonable steps** to meet its obligations.  

Without written policies, even well-intentioned practices may fail to **demonstrate compliance** to regulators.  

:::danger Critical Point
**Documented policies** are mandatory under the DPDPA. They protect the organization from **penalties, audits, and reputational damage**, and prove that compliance is **systematic, not ad hoc**.
