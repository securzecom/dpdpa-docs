For many organizations, the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023** may feel complex at first. But compliance begins with a few structured steps.  

The goal is to create a framework where personal data is **collected, processed, and stored** in a way that respects the **rights of individuals** and meets the **legal requirements** of the Act.

## Step 1: Conduct a Gap Assessment

A **gap assessment** is the starting point. It is a review of your current data handling practices compared against the requirements of the DPDPA.  

- Identify what types of personal data you currently collect (**customer, employee, vendor, partner**).  
- Review how that data is **stored, used, and shared**.  
- Compare these practices with the **obligations under DPDPA**, such as providing clear notices, limiting retention, and reporting breaches.  

The outcome will show where your organization is already compliant and where **changes are needed**.  

:::info Example  
A **retail e-commerce company** may discover that it collects more customer data than necessary (such as storing **passport numbers** when only **PAN** is required for billing). The gap assessment will highlight this **excess collection** as a compliance issue.

:::danger Critical Point
A **gap assessment** is the **foundation** of compliance. Without it, organizations risk overlooking weaknesses that may lead to **breaches, penalties, or reputational harm**.
