## Step 11: Compliance Checklists by Industry

While the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 applies to all organizations, the risks and requirements differ depending on the industry. Each sector handles unique categories of personal data — financial, health, identity, behavioral — and therefore needs tailored compliance steps.

### 1. Banking and Financial Services
**Data Handled:** KYC documents, account details, transaction histories, credit scores.  

**Checklist:**  
- Encrypt all sensitive data (Aadhaar, PAN, bank accounts).  
- Retain KYC data only for the RBI-mandated period (10 years after account closure).  
- Appoint a Grievance Officer; large banks will likely qualify as SDFs and must appoint a DPO.  
- Test and document breach response plans to meet the 72-hour reporting deadline.  
- Audit third-party vendors (credit bureaus, payment gateways) for DPDPA compliance.  

:::info Tip
Create a customer rights portal where account holders can request access, correction, or closure of their data.

### Why Industry-Specific Checklists Matter
The same law applies differently depending on the type of data and risks involved. A hospital leaking genetic test results is far more damaging than a retailer losing a phone number. Tailored checklists help organizations focus on the highest-risk areas in their sector and implement compliance efficiently.
