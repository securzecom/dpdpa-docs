The **DPDPA** requires every organization (**Data Fiduciary**) to provide individuals with a **clear, standalone privacy notice** before processing their personal data.  

A compliant privacy notice must:  
- Explain **what personal data** is being collected.  
- State **why the data** is being collected (**the purpose**).  
- Provide details of **whom to contact** for questions or complaints (**Grievance Officer or DPO**).  
- Explain how individuals can **exercise their rights** (access, correction, erasure, withdrawal of consent).  
- Be written in **clear and simple language**, available in **English** and **local languages**.  

:::info Example  
An **insurance company** updating its claim portal must add a notice that explains:  

> “We are collecting your Aadhaar and medical records to process your claim. For questions, please contact our Grievance Officer at **grievance@abcinsurance.com**.”  
:::

:::danger Critical Point
The **privacy notice** cannot be hidden in lengthy terms and conditions. It must be **standalone, simple, and multilingual** so that every Data Principal can understand it.
