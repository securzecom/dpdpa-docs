# Q4 - What happens if an SDF fails to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before launching a new high-risk product?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, conducting a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** is a **mandatory obligation** for all **Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)** as per **Section 10(2)(c)**. Failure to carry out a DPIA before initiating a new high-risk data-processing activity is treated as a **breach of the Act**, which can trigger investigation, penalties, and corrective measures by the **Data Protection Board of India**.

### **1. Legal Requirement**

> **Section 10(2)(c)** —  
> Every Significant Data Fiduciary shall undertake **periodic data protection impact assessments**, periodic audits, and such other measures as may be prescribed to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Act

This means that before launching any **new product, feature, or processing activity** involving large-scale or sensitive data, the SDF must perform and document a DPIA to identify and mitigate privacy and security risks.

### **2. Consequences of Non-Compliance**

If an SDF launches a high-risk product without conducting a DPIA, the **Data Protection Board** may:

- **Initiate an inquiry** under **Section 27–28** to determine the nature and extent of the violation.  
- **Impose penalties** under **Section 33(1)** and the **Schedule**, which lists breaches of SDF obligations under **Section 10** as punishable by a fine of up to **₹150 crore**
- **Issue corrective directions**, including suspension of processing, requirement to conduct an immediate DPIA, or appointment of an independent auditor.

The Board also considers the **nature, gravity, and duration** of the breach, the type of data involved, and whether the SDF took any **mitigation measures** afterward.

---

### **3. Practical Impact**

Failure to perform a DPIA can have serious business consequences:
- Launch delays if the Board orders a post-facto DPIA or temporary suspension.  
- Damage to trust and compliance ratings with regulators and partners.  
- Potential loss of SDF status or stricter oversight in future audits.

:::info Example
A major e-commerce platform designated as an **SDF** introduces an AI-based recommendation engine using customer behavior and location data without performing a DPIA. A privacy complaint leads to a **Data Protection Board inquiry**, which finds that the system lacked risk analysis for profiling and potential discrimination. The Board imposes a **₹75 crore penalty**, orders a retroactive DPIA, and directs temporary suspension of the feature until compliance is demonstrated.
