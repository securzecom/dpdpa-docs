# Q4 - What happens if an SDF fails to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before launching a new high-risk product?

Failure to conduct a DPIA is a serious violation. Consequences include:  

- Investigation by the Board.  
- Orders to suspend or modify the processing activity until compliance is achieved.  
- Financial penalties, potentially running into crores, depending on the risk caused to individuals.  

:::info Example
If a large insurance company launches an AI-based health scoring app without a DPIA and the app discriminates against people with pre-existing conditions, the Board can impose heavy fines, require an immediate stop to processing, and order corrective action.
