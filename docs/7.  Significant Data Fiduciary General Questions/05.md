# Q5 - Are SDFs subject to stricter penalties compared to ordinary Data Fiduciaries?

:::tip Answer
Yes. Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, **Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)** are subject to **stricter penalties and compliance scrutiny** than ordinary Data Fiduciaries. This is because SDFs handle **larger volumes** or **more sensitive types of personal data**, and their operations have a **higher potential impact** on individuals and public interest.

---

### **1. Legal Basis**

The DPDPA explicitly provides additional obligations for SDFs under **Section 10(2)**, such as:
- Appointment of a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** based in India.  
- Engagement of an **independent Data Auditor**.  
- Conducting periodic **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** and compliance audits.  

Failure to meet these obligations is classified as a **specific breach category** under the Schedule of the Act and carries **higher penalty ceilings**.

### **2. Comparative Penalty Structure**

| Type of Breach | Relevant Section | Applicable Entity | Maximum Penalty |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Breach of general provisions of the Act | Section 33(1) & Schedule (Entry 7) | Any Data Fiduciary | ₹50 crore |
| Breach of obligations relating to children’s data | Section 9 | Any Data Fiduciary | ₹200 crore |
| Breach of security safeguards (data breach) | Section 8(5) | Any Data Fiduciary | ₹250 crore |
| **Breach of additional obligations of SDFs** | **Section 10(2)** | **Significant Data Fiduciary** | **₹150 crore** |

These penalty caps are drawn from the **Schedule** attached to the DPDPA, which specifies penalties for each type of violation.

### **3. Why SDFs Are Held to a Higher Standard**

The **Central Government** designates certain organizations as SDFs under **Section 10(1)** based on factors such as:
- Volume and sensitivity of data processed.  
- Risk of harm to Data Principals.  
- Impact on sovereignty, democracy, or public order.

Because of these heightened risks, SDFs are expected to demonstrate **advanced accountability and governance measures**, and any breach of these duties attracts **proportionally higher penalties**.

---

### **4. How Penalties Are Determined**

Under **Section 33(2)**, the **Data Protection Board of India** considers the following while determining the fine amount:
- Nature, gravity, and duration of the breach.  
- Type and sensitivity of personal data involved.  
- Whether the SDF acted negligently or repeatedly.  
- Steps taken to mitigate harm and cooperate during inquiry.  
- Whether the penalty is proportionate and effective for deterrence.

---

### **5. Practical Implication**

Ordinary Data Fiduciaries may face compliance audits occasionally or upon complaint, but SDFs are:
- **Regularly audited**,  
- **Monitored for DPIA compliance**, and  
- **More likely to face higher penalties** for lapses due to their critical role and risk exposure.

---

:::info Example
A fintech company classified as a **Significant Data Fiduciary** fails to perform its annual independent audit and launches a new AI credit-scoring tool without a DPIA. The **Data Protection Board** investigates the lapse and imposes a penalty of ₹90 crore, citing breach of obligations under **Section 10(2)**. A smaller startup processing limited customer data, by contrast, would likely face a lighter penalty or warning for similar non-compliance.
