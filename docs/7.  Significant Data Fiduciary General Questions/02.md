# Q2 - Once classified as an SDF, can a company appeal or challenge that designation?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* does **not provide a direct mechanism** within Section 10 itself for challenging the Central Government’s decision to classify an entity as a **Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)**. However, the Act provides a **general right of appeal** under **Chapter VII (Sections 29–30)** that can be used to challenge **orders or directions** made by authorities under the Act, including those issued by or under the authority of the Central Government or the **Data Protection Board of India**.

### **1. Nature of SDF Notification**

Under **Section 10(1)**, the Central Government may notify any Data Fiduciary or class of Data Fiduciaries as a **Significant Data Fiduciary** based on factors such as:
- Volume and sensitivity of personal data processed,  
- Risk to rights of Data Principals,  
- Potential impact on sovereignty or public order, etc. 

Such a notification is an **executive decision** taken through an official Gazette notification, meaning it applies by law once published.

### **2. Possibility of Appeal**

Although the DPDPA does not explicitly describe an appeal process against SDF notification, a company may seek redress through the following paths:

#### **a. Administrative Review / Representation**
A company can make a **representation to the Central Government** requesting reconsideration or revocation of its classification, especially if:
- The company believes that the factors considered were inaccurate, or  
- The scale or nature of its data processing has changed significantly.  

The Government retains discretionary power under Section 10(1) to review or amend earlier notifications.

#### **b. Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal**
If the designation arises from or is linked to an **order or direction issued by the Data Protection Board**, the company can appeal under **Section 29(1)**.  
This section allows *“any person aggrieved by an order or direction made by the Board under this Act”* to appeal to the **Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)** within 60 days of receiving the order. The Tribunal can **confirm, modify, or set aside** the decision.

#### **c. Judicial Review by High Court**
If the classification was made solely through a **Government notification** (not by the Board), the organization’s recourse would be **judicial review** under **Article 226 of the Constitution of India**.  
The High Court can examine whether the classification violated principles of natural justice or lacked reasonable grounds.

### **3. Summary of Options**

| Stage | Authority Involved | Applicable Provision | Type of Review |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Step 1 | Central Government | Section 10(1) | Administrative reconsideration |
| Step 2 | Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) | Section 29(1) | Appeal against Board’s order or direction |
| Step 3 | High Court (Judicial Review) | Constitutional remedy (Art. 226) | Legal challenge to Government notification |

:::info Example
A mid-sized data-analytics company is notified as a **Significant Data Fiduciary** due to its handling of large financial datasets. The company believes the classification overestimates its risk profile. It first files a representation to the **Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY)** requesting reconsideration. If rejected, and if the designation results in a Board order imposing new compliance directions, it may appeal that order to the **Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)** within 60 days. As a final step, the company may approach the **High Court** for judicial review.
