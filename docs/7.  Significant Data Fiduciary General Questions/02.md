# Once classified as an SDF, can a company appeal or challenge that designation?

Yes.  

A company designated as an SDF can appeal to the **Appellate Tribunal** if it believes the classification is unnecessary or unfair.  
The Tribunal can review whether the government applied the criteria appropriately.  

:::info Example
If a mid-sized fintech company with 100,000 customers is suddenly notified as an SDF, it may argue that its scale does not justify the additional compliance burden.  

It can challenge the notification through the Tribunal process.
