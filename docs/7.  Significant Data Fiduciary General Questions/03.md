# Q3 - Do SDFs have to appoint their Data Protection Officer (DPO) in India, even if they are a multinational company headquartered elsewhere?

:::tip Answer
Yes. Under **Section 10(2)(a)(ii)** of the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, every **Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)** is **legally required** to appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is based in India**, regardless of where the company’s global headquarters or parent entity is located.

### **1. Legal Requirement**

> **Section 10(2)(a)** —  
> Every Significant Data Fiduciary shall appoint a Data Protection Officer who shall:  
> 1. **Represent the SDF** under the provisions of this Act;  
> 2. **Be based in India**;  
> 3. **Report to the Board of Directors or equivalent governing body**; and  
> 4. **Serve as the point of contact for grievance redressal** under this Act.

This makes it clear that the **physical location of the DPO** — not just the organization — must be **within India**, ensuring local accountability and ease of regulatory coordination with the **Data Protection Board of India**.

### **2. Purpose Behind the “Based in India” Requirement**

The DPDPA mandates local presence for DPOs to:
- Ensure **direct communication** with Indian regulators and Data Principals.  
- Enable **timely compliance** with inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions by the **Data Protection Board of India**.  
- Provide an **on-ground grievance redressal mechanism** for Indian users.  
- Avoid situations where accountability is shifted to overseas offices or foreign jurisdictions.

This requirement is similar to global frameworks like the EU’s GDPR, which requires **representatives within the EU** for foreign controllers and processors.

### **3. Implications for Multinational Companies**

For multinational companies operating in India:
- The **India DPO** acts as the local compliance and liaison officer for the organization’s Indian operations.  
- The DPO may coordinate with a **global privacy or compliance head**, but must have the **authority and autonomy** to act on behalf of the company before Indian authorities.  
- If multiple Indian entities exist within the same corporate group, a **group-level DPO** may be appointed in India, provided they have oversight and accountability across those entities.

Failing to appoint a locally based DPO can lead to **non-compliance** and potential penalties under **Section 33(1)** of the DPDPA.

:::info Example
A U.S.-headquartered technology company operates a major data-processing subsidiary in Bengaluru that handles millions of Indian users’ data. The Central Government notifies it as a **Significant Data Fiduciary**. Even though the global Chief Privacy Officer sits in New York, the company must appoint a **Data Protection Officer physically based in India** who can represent the organization before the **Data Protection Board of India** and handle local grievances.
