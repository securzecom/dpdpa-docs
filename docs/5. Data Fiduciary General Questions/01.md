# Q1 - What is the difference between a Data Fiduciary and a Data Processor?

A **Data Fiduciary** is the person or organization that decides **why** personal data is being collected and **how** it will be used.  
They are responsible for making sure that all data is handled lawfully, securely, and for the right purpose.  
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, the Data Fiduciary holds the main responsibility for protecting the personal data of individuals (called **Data Principals**).

A **Data Processor** is a person or company that processes personal data **on behalf of the Data Fiduciary**.  
They donâ€™t decide the purpose or method of processing â€” they simply follow the instructions given by the Data Fiduciary.  
The Processor cannot use or share the data for any other reason.

The key difference is that the **Data Fiduciary has control and accountability**, while the **Data Processor only performs the tasks assigned**.  
Even if the Processor makes a mistake or there is a data breach, the Fiduciary remains responsible under the law.

### ðŸ§© Real-World Examples

:::info Example 1 â€“ Banking Sector
  A bank collects and analyses customer data to approve loans. The bank decides why and how the data is used â€” so it is the **Data Fiduciary**. If the bank hires a cloud service provider (like AWS or Azure) to store this customer data, that provider is the **Data Processor**.

:::info Example 2 â€“ E-Commerce Platform 
  An online store collects customer names, addresses, and payment details to deliver orders. The store is the **Data Fiduciary** because it decides the purpose of collecting that information. If it hires a marketing company to send promotional emails or a logistics partner to deliver goods, those partners act as **Data Processors**.

:::info Example 3 â€“ Health-Tech App:
  A healthcare company runs a telemedicine app that stores patient health records. The company decides why the data is collected and how itâ€™s used â€” it is the **Data Fiduciary**. If it outsources its database management to an IT vendor, that vendor is the **Data Processor**.
