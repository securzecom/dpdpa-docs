# Q2 - Can a single organization act as a Data Fiduciary for one activity and a Data Processor for another?

:::tip Answer
Yes. A single organization can act as a **Data Fiduciary** for one activity and a **Data Processor** for another, depending on the purpose and context of processing.  
:::
If an organization decides **why and how** personal data is collected or used, it functions as a **Data Fiduciary** under **Section 2(i)** of the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023*. If it processes personal data **on behalf of another entity** and only follows that entity’s instructions, it acts as a **Data Processor** under **Section 2(k)**.  

Additionally, **Section 8(1)** states that a Data Fiduciary remains responsible for compliance even when processing is carried out by a Data Processor on its behalf. This confirms that a single entity may perform both roles in different situations, based on its control and responsibility over the data.
