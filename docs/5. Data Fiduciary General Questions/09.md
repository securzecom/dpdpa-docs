# Q9 - What happens when multiple Fiduciaries share data — who carries liability if something goes wrong?

:::tip Answer
When multiple **Data Fiduciaries** share or exchange personal data, each one is responsible for ensuring compliance with the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* **for the part of processing it controls**. Liability depends on which Fiduciary’s actions (or failures) caused the breach, misuse, or non-compliance.

### **1. Independent Obligations of Each Data Fiduciary**

Under **Section 8(1)**, every Data Fiduciary is independently responsible for complying with the Act — even if data is shared with, or received from, another Fiduciary.  
Each organization must:
- Ensure that the data was lawfully collected and processed.  
- Use the data only for the specified or consented purpose.  
- Maintain adequate security safeguards and access controls.  
- Respond appropriately to withdrawal of consent or data-breach notifications.

There is **no concept of “joint immunity”** under the DPDPA — meaning one Fiduciary cannot escape responsibility by claiming that another handled the data.

### **2. Determining Liability When a Breach Occurs**

If a personal data breach, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure occurs:
- The **Data Fiduciary responsible for the breach** (e.g., the one that lost, leaked, or misused the data) will bear **primary liability**.  
- If multiple Fiduciaries are involved in a connected chain of processing, the **Data Protection Board of India** may examine each entity’s role to determine accountability.  
- Under **Section 33(1)**, the Board may impose monetary penalties on one or more Fiduciaries depending on their degree of negligence or non-compliance.

### **3. Shared or Sequential Processing Scenarios**

In many real-world cases, multiple Data Fiduciaries handle the same data for related purposes (for example, between a bank, an insurance company, and a credit bureau).  
Each Fiduciary must independently satisfy the conditions of lawful processing and must not rely solely on another party’s compliance.

:::info Example
A bank shares verified customer information with an insurance company for providing an insurance-linked credit card.  
- The **bank** acts as a Data Fiduciary for collecting and verifying the data.  
- The **insurance company** becomes a separate Data Fiduciary once it uses that data for issuing the policy.  
If the insurance company later exposes the data through a breach, **it alone** will be liable for that incident — not the bank.  

However, if the bank failed to obtain proper consent for sharing the data in the first place, **the bank** would also share liability.

### **4. Oversight and Penalties**

The **Data Protection Board of India** (under **Sections 27–28**) has the authority to:
- Investigate multi-party breaches.  
- Determine the extent of each Fiduciary’s fault.  
- Impose proportional penalties as specified in the **Schedule** (up to ₹250 crore for severe violations).
