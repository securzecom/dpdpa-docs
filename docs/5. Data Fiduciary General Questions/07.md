# Q7 - What is the relationship between a Data Fiduciary and a Consent Manager — is one more powerful than the other?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, the **Data Fiduciary** and the **Consent Manager** have **distinct but complementary roles**. Neither is more powerful than the other — they perform different functions within the same data-protection ecosystem.

### **1. Role of the Data Fiduciary**
A **Data Fiduciary** is the entity that determines **why** and **how** personal data is processed. It is legally responsible for ensuring that:
- Consent is obtained lawfully and transparently.  
- Data is processed only for the stated purpose.  
- Security safeguards, retention limits, and grievance mechanisms are in place.  
- All obligations under the DPDPA are met.

The Fiduciary remains **fully accountable** for compliance, even when it uses a Consent Manager to collect or manage consent on its behalf.

### **2. Role of the Consent Manager**
A **Consent Manager**, defined under **Section 2(g)** and further described in **Section 6(7)–(9)**, is a **Board-registered intermediary** that provides a **standardised, interoperable platform** through which individuals (Data Principals) can:
- Give, manage, review, or withdraw consent.  
- View the history of consents granted to different Data Fiduciaries.  
- Exercise their data-protection rights conveniently.

The Consent Manager acts as a **neutral interface** between the individual and the Data Fiduciary.  
It does **not decide how data is processed** — it only enables consent to be communicated, stored, and managed securely.

### **3. Nature of Their Relationship**
- The **Data Fiduciary** is the **decision-maker and accountable party**.  
- The **Consent Manager** is a **facilitator** that ensures consent is verifiable, standardised, and easy for individuals to control.  
- The Consent Manager is **accountable to the Data Principal**, while the Data Fiduciary is **accountable to both the Data Principal and the Data Protection Board**.  
- Their relationship is **co-operative, not hierarchical** — one does not have authority over the other.

:::info Example
An online healthcare platform wants to collect patients’ consent to process medical records. The platform (Data Fiduciary) integrates a registered Consent Manager’s API to manage this process. The patient gives or withdraws consent through the Consent Manager’s interface, but the Fiduciary remains responsible for how the medical data is used, stored, and protected.
