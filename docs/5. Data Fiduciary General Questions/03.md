# Q3 - How does the government decide if a Fiduciary should be classified as a Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)?

:::tip Answer
The Central Government may notify a Fiduciary as an SDF based on specific factors:  
- The volume and sensitivity of the data it processes.  
- The risk of harm to Data Principals if something goes wrong.  
- The potential impact on sovereignty, integrity, or national security.  
- The likelihood of influencing electoral democracy or public order.

:::info Example
A social media platform like ABC Connect processing millions of user profiles, private messages, and facial images is highly likely to be declared an SDF.  

A local retail chain processing a few thousand loyalty card details will not qualify.  

This approach ensures regulation is risk-based: bigger impact = stricter obligations.
