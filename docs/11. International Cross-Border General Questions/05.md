# Q5 - What is the government’s role in regulating cross-border transfers?

:::tip Answer
- The default position is that cross-border transfers are allowed.  
- The government may notify “restricted jurisdictions” where transfers are prohibited or limited.  
- This model avoids blanket localization but still protects sovereignty and national security.

:::info Example
If the government notifies that data cannot be sent to “Country A” due to hostile activities, even a social media company with servers there must immediately stop processing Indian data in that location.
