# Q4 - Can Indian companies continue to use global cloud service providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)?

:::tip Answer
Yes — Indian companies can **continue to use global cloud service providers** such as **AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure**, or others under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*. The Act does **not prohibit or restrict** using foreign-owned or global cloud platforms, as long as the **personal data of Indian users** is processed **lawfully, securely, and within permitted jurisdictions**.
:::

### **1. Legal Position**

> **Section 16(1)** —  
> The **transfer of personal data outside India** is permitted **except to countries or territories restricted by the Central Government** for reasons of national interest.

This means Indian companies are **free to host or process data on global cloud servers**, as long as:
- The data is stored or processed in countries **not on the restricted list**, and  
- The company ensures **all DPDPA obligations** (consent, safeguards, breach notifications, etc.) are followed.

As of now, **no countries have been restricted**, so global cloud platforms remain fully usable.

### **2. Role of Cloud Providers Under DPDPA**

Cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP) typically act as **Data Processors**, meaning they process data **on behalf of Indian clients (Data Fiduciaries)**.  
The Indian company remains **primarily responsible** for compliance — not the cloud provider — but must ensure that the processor:

- Implements strong **technical and organizational security controls** (as required under **Section 8(5)**).  
- Processes data **only under written contract or instruction** from the company.  
- Assists in **reporting breaches** to the **Data Protection Board** if any occur.

---

### **3. Security and Compliance Expectations**

To remain compliant while using global cloud providers, Indian companies must:

1. **Review Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** — Ensure they cover DPDPA-specific obligations like lawful processing, breach reporting, and data deletion.  
2. **Enable Encryption and Access Controls** — Maintain confidentiality and integrity of data during transfer and storage.  
3. **Store Backups Securely** — Especially for sensitive or regulated sectors (BFSI, healthcare, etc.).  
4. **Monitor Data Location** — Confirm that data is not transferred to any future “restricted” country.  
5. **Verify Breach Notification Clauses** — Ensure the cloud provider promptly alerts you of any incident affecting your data.

:::info Example
A fintech startup in Mumbai hosts its applications on **AWS’s Singapore data center**. It processes Indian customers’ payment data under consent, applies encryption, and follows breach-reporting norms. Since Singapore is **not a restricted territory** and the startup maintains compliance, this setup is **fully legal under DPDPA**.

:::warning Example
If, in the future, the Government restricts certain countries for security reasons, companies will need to **shift their data or services** to allowed regions. Failing to comply after such notification could attract penalties under **Section 33**, up to **₹250 crore**.

### **4. Sector-Specific Rules Still Apply**

While DPDPA allows foreign cloud usage, **sectoral regulators** may impose additional conditions:
- **RBI** requires certain payment and financial data to be **stored within India**.  
- **IRDAI** and **SEBI** have similar expectations for sensitive customer data.  
Companies must therefore comply with **both DPDPA and their sector regulator’s rules**.

---

### **5. Key Takeaway**

- **Yes**, Indian companies can continue using **global cloud providers**.  
- Compliance responsibility lies with the **Indian company (Data Fiduciary)**.  
- Data transfers are allowed **except to restricted countries**.  
- Security, encryption, and contractual safeguards are essential.  
- Sectoral regulators may impose **additional localization requirements**.
