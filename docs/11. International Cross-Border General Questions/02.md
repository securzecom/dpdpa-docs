# Q2 - What happens when Indian law conflicts with foreign privacy laws (like GDPR or CCPA)?

:::tip Answer
When Indian law — specifically the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* — conflicts with foreign privacy frameworks such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** of the EU or the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** of the U.S., the **applicable law depends on where the data is being processed and which users the data belongs to.**
:::

In essence:
- **DPDPA governs data of Indian residents or users in India**, regardless of where it is processed.  
- **GDPR, CCPA, or other regional laws** govern data of users from their respective jurisdictions.  
When the same company processes data of users from multiple regions, it must comply with **all applicable laws simultaneously**, and resolve conflicts by applying the **stricter rule** wherever possible.

### **1. Jurisdictional Boundaries**

| **Law** | **Applies To** | **Territorial Reach** |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **DPDPA (India)** | Processing of personal data of individuals located in India | Applies **within and outside India**, if offering goods or services to Indian users |
| **GDPR (EU)** | Processing of data of EU residents | Applies globally to any entity offering goods/services to or monitoring EU users |
| **CCPA (California, U.S.)** | Processing of data of California residents | Applies globally to businesses meeting thresholds and serving California consumers |

Each law has **extraterritorial effect** — meaning companies can be simultaneously subject to multiple privacy regimes.

---

### **2. Priority of DPDPA for Indian Data**

> **Section 3(b)** of DPDPA extends the Act to **processing outside India** when it relates to **offering goods or services to individuals within India**.  

This makes DPDPA **mandatory** for any company handling Indian user data, even if it’s based abroad.  
If the same data processing activity is also subject to GDPR or CCPA, the organization must ensure its operations satisfy **all frameworks**.

---

### **3. When Conflicts Arise**

Conflicts usually appear in three areas:
1. **Cross-border data transfers**  
   - GDPR restricts data transfers outside the EU unless the destination country ensures adequate protection.  
   - DPDPA allows cross-border transfers except to countries restricted by the Indian government.  
   - A company may therefore need to comply with **both transfer restrictions** simultaneously.

2. **User rights**  
   - GDPR provides rights such as **data portability**, which DPDPA does not.  
   - DPDPA provides the **Right to Nominate** (post-death data control), which GDPR does not.  
   - Companies serving both user groups must design systems that support **the full combined set of rights**.

3. **Breach notification timelines**  
   - GDPR requires breach reporting within **72 hours**.  
   - India’s CERT-In Directions (2022) require it within **6 hours**.  
   - The **stricter timeline prevails** to ensure global compliance.

:::info Example
A multinational fintech company processes both Indian and EU user data on the same infrastructure hosted in Singapore.  
- It must comply with **GDPR** for EU users and **DPDPA** for Indian users.  
- If a data breach occurs, it must notify both **EU regulators** (within 72 hours) and the **Data Protection Board of India** (as soon as practicable or within the prescribed time).  
- If the laws differ, the company applies the **stricter rule** to ensure compliance in both jurisdictions.

### **4. How Companies Handle Dual Compliance**

To avoid conflict and duplication, global organizations often:
- Maintain **separate data maps** for each region (India, EU, U.S.).  
- Implement **region-specific consent forms** and privacy notices.  
- Design **privacy policies** that reference compliance under multiple frameworks.  
- Use **modular compliance programs** — one global baseline aligned with the strictest obligations (GDPR), extended to cover local variations (DPDPA, CCPA, etc.).

---

### **5. Government Coordination**

DPDPA empowers the **Central Government** to issue guidelines or enter **reciprocal arrangements** with other jurisdictions to:
- Facilitate **cross-border data flows**;  
- Prevent **regulatory overlap**; and  
- Promote **interoperability of privacy frameworks** (Section 40).

These arrangements are expected to work similarly to the **EU’s adequacy decisions**, harmonizing compliance between India and trusted jurisdictions.

---

:::warning
If an organization ignores DPDPA obligations on the assumption that GDPR or CCPA already cover them, it risks **independent penalties** under Indian law — including fines up to **₹250 crore** for data breach or unlawful processing.
:::

---

### **6. Key Takeaway**

- DPDPA applies to **Indian users’ data**, regardless of where it’s processed.  
- Companies serving multiple regions must comply with **each applicable law**.  
- In cases of overlap or conflict, organizations should **follow the stricter or more protective standard** to stay compliant globally.  
- The Central Government may later issue **harmonization rules** to simplify cross-border compliance.

**Referenced Provisions:**  
- **Section 3(b)** – Extraterritorial applicability of DPDPA.  
- **Section 16(1)** – Restrictions on cross-border data transfers.  
- **Section 40(2)** – Government’s power to harmonize with other laws.  
- **Schedule (Entry 2)** – Penalties for breach of security safeguards (up to ₹250 crore).
