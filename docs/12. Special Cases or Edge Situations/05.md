# Q5 - How does DPDPA apply to educational institutions handling minors’ data?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* applies fully to **schools, colleges, and educational platforms** that collect, store, or process **students’ personal data**, especially when those students are **under 18 years of age**.  

Since the Act defines a **“child”** as anyone below 18, educational institutions must treat all such data as **sensitive personal data** and follow stricter obligations to ensure safety, consent, and lawful processing.

### **1. Key Legal Provisions**

> **Section 9(1)** —  
> A Data Fiduciary shall, before processing any personal data of a child or a person with disability having a lawful guardian, **obtain verifiable consent** of the parent or lawful guardian.  

> **Section 9(2)** —  
> A Data Fiduciary shall not undertake processing that is **detrimental to the well-being of a child**.  

> **Section 9(3)** —  
> A Data Fiduciary shall not engage in **tracking, behavioural monitoring, or targeted advertising** directed at children

---

### **2. What This Means for Educational Institutions**

Educational institutions — whether public, private, or digital — are **Data Fiduciaries** when handling student information.  
They must:

- Obtain **verifiable parental or guardian consent** before collecting any data (e.g., during admission, registration, or e-learning access).  
- Avoid any form of **profiling or advertising** aimed at children.  
- Ensure all student data is used **only for educational or welfare purposes**.  
- Protect data with **strong security measures** to prevent misuse, breaches, or leaks.  

Failure to comply can attract penalties up to **₹200–₹250 crore**, depending on severity.

### **3. Examples of Covered Data**

| **Type of Data** | **Examples** | **Compliance Requirement** |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Identity Information** | Name, age, address, Aadhaar, ID card, guardian details | Must be collected with parental consent |
| **Educational Records** | Marks, attendance, report cards | Use only for academic or administrative purposes |
| **Digital Learning Data** | Online classroom logs, LMS usage, device info | Must ensure privacy and prevent profiling |
| **CCTV or Biometric Data** | Entry footage, facial scans, fingerprint attendance | Requires explicit parental consent and strict access controls |

---

:::info Example
A school using an app to record attendance through face recognition must first **obtain verifiable parental consent** and ensure the app does not share data with third parties for analytics or advertising.

### **4. Prohibition on Behavioural Tracking and Ads**

DPDPA strictly bans:
- **Tracking or behavioural profiling** of children (e.g., monitoring browsing history or classroom device activity for marketing insights).  
- **Targeted ads** directed at minors.  

Any learning platform or ed-tech provider engaging in such activities would be in **violation of Section 9(3)**.

---

### **5. Government Oversight and Safe-Processing Exemptions**

> **Section 9(5)** allows the **Central Government** to notify classes of Data Fiduciaries as “**verifiably safe processors**.”  
If the Government is satisfied that an institution ensures **child-safe processing**, it may **exempt** that organization from certain obligations (like repeated parental consent).  

This provision is expected to benefit reputed schools or ed-tech platforms with **certified child-safety frameworks**.

---

### **6. Key Takeaway**

- Schools, colleges, and ed-tech platforms processing student data are **fully covered under DPDPA**.  
- They must:
  - Obtain **verifiable parental consent**.  
  - Ensure **no harmful or commercial use** of children’s data.  
  - **Avoid tracking and advertising** directed at minors.  
  - Maintain **robust security and transparency**.  
- The Government may grant exemptions only to institutions proven to follow **verifiably safe child-data practices**.
