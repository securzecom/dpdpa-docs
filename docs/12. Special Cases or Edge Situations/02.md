# Q2 - How does the law apply to NGOs, schools, and hospitals that are not-for-profit but still collect personal data?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* applies **equally** to all organizations — whether **for-profit or not-for-profit** — as long as they **collect, store, or process personal data** in digital form.  

This means that **NGOs, schools, hospitals, and charitable trusts** are all considered **Data Fiduciaries** under the Act whenever they handle data about individuals (Data Principals). Their non-commercial status does **not exempt them** from compliance.

### **1. Applicability in Simple Terms**

> **Section 3(a)** —  
> The Act applies to the processing of **digital personal data within India**, collected online or digitized offline, regardless of whether the entity is for profit or not.

So even if a school or NGO does not sell products or services, it still processes **personal data** such as:
- Student or patient names, addresses, Aadhaar numbers  
- Health or educational records  
- Donor or volunteer contact information  
- CCTV footage or biometric attendance data  

Hence, DPDPA obligations apply just as they do to businesses.

### **2. Common Scenarios**

| **Type of Organization** | **Personal Data Collected** | **Purpose** | **DPDPA Applicability** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **School or College** | Student names, attendance, marks, guardian details | Education management, safety, exams | Covered – must ensure lawful processing and notices |
| **Hospital or Clinic** | Patient records, prescriptions, diagnostic data | Treatment and insurance claims | Covered – sensitive health data, must apply strong safeguards |
| **NGO or Charity** | Beneficiary details, IDs, bank info for welfare distribution | Running welfare or aid programs | Covered – even if not commercial, data security still mandatory |

---

### **3. Consent and Lawful Processing**

These entities must:
- Obtain **free and informed consent** when collecting personal data (e.g., during admissions, registrations, or medical check-ins).  
- Clearly explain the **purpose of collection** (e.g., educational records, patient treatment, or aid distribution).  
- Process data only for **legitimate purposes** and **not beyond stated needs**.

Even if consent is implied for the core service (like education or healthcare), secondary use — e.g., **sharing data with sponsors, vendors, or advertisers** — still requires **explicit consent**.

---

:::info Example
A private school collects student data for enrollment, grading, and parent communication — this is lawful and necessary.  
But if the same school shares parent contact details with an external vendor to market tutoring apps, that would violate DPDPA’s **purpose limitation** and **consent** requirements.

### **4. Special Responsibilities for Sensitive Data**

Hospitals and NGOs handling **health or disability data** must apply **heightened safeguards** under **Section 8(5)**, including:
- Secure storage and encryption of records  
- Strict access control  
- Breach reporting to the **Data Protection Board of India** and affected individuals  

Because such data carries higher risk of harm, negligence in handling it can result in **penalties up to ₹250 crore** under **Section 33**.

---

### **5. Government & Regulatory Exemptions**

Certain government-funded entities (like public hospitals or state schools) may receive **limited exemptions** under **Section 17**, but these apply **only when performing functions under law** — not for all data uses.  
For example:
- A government hospital maintaining health records for national programs may be exempt from certain consent provisions.  
- But if it uses that data for research or third-party sharing, full DPDPA rules apply again.

---

:::info Example
An NGO collects beneficiary data (names, Aadhaar, and bank details) to distribute financial aid. If the data is later shared with another organization for analytics without explicit consent, it breaches DPDPA principles — even though the NGO is not-for-profit.

### **6. Compliance Simplified for Nonprofits**

To comply effectively, NGOs, schools, and hospitals should:
1. Publish a **privacy notice** explaining what data is collected and why.  
2. Limit data use strictly to the purpose for which it was collected.  
3. Maintain **reasonable security safeguards** (password protection, encryption, access logs).  
4. Report breaches to the **Data Protection Board** and affected individuals promptly.  
5. Erase or anonymize personal data once no longer required.  

---

### **7. Key Takeaway**

- DPDPA applies to **all entities processing personal data**, regardless of profit status.  
- **NGOs, schools, and hospitals** must act as **Data Fiduciaries** and follow the same standards of transparency, security, and accountability.  
- Being not-for-profit does **not exempt** them from penalties for mishandling data.  
- The only limited relaxations may come through **future Government rules or notifications**, not by default.
