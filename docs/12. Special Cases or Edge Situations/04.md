# Q4 - What happens if a company shuts down — does it have to delete all personal data first?

:::tip Answer
Yes. When a company permanently shuts down or ceases operations, it must **delete or anonymize all personal data** in its possession — unless there is a **legal, regulatory, or contractual reason** to retain it.  

The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* makes it clear that **personal data cannot be kept indefinitely** once its purpose is fulfilled, even if the business closes.

### **1. Legal Obligation to Delete Data**

> **Section 8(7)** —  
> A Data Fiduciary shall **erase personal data** when it is reasonable to assume that the **specified purpose is no longer being served**,  
> or **retention is no longer necessary** for legal or business purposes, unless retention is required by law.

This applies equally to companies that:
- Shut down voluntarily,  
- Are merged or acquired, or  
- Are declared insolvent or liquidated.

In each case, data held by the company — including customer, employee, and vendor records — must be **securely erased or anonymized** before closure.

---

### **2. What Must Be Deleted**

All **digital personal data** collected during operations must be securely wiped, such as:
- Customer information (names, phone numbers, emails, IDs, financial details)  
- Employee records (HR files, payroll data, performance logs)  
- Vendor or partner contact information  
- User analytics, cookies, or backup data stored on servers or cloud systems  

If the company used **third-party processors** (e.g., cloud providers, marketing platforms), it must instruct them to **delete or return the data** and confirm completion.

---

:::info Example
A startup offering a financial app shuts down due to bankruptcy. Before winding up, it must permanently **delete all user data**, close cloud accounts, and document proof of deletion — unless certain records must be retained for **tax, audit, or legal disputes**.

### **3. When Data Can Be Retained**

The only exceptions are when **retention is legally required**, such as:
- **Tax or accounting laws** (e.g., income tax, GST filings, audits)  
- **Employment laws** (e.g., PF or ESIC recordkeeping)  
- **Regulatory compliance** for sectors like banking, insurance, or telecom  

Even then, data must be:
- Kept **only for the mandated duration**, and  
- **Securely stored**, with limited access until deletion.

Once all legal retention obligations end, the organization must **erase the data completely**.

---

:::warning Example
If a healthcare startup shuts down but keeps patient records “for future reference,” this would violate DPDPA’s **purpose limitation** and **data retention** clauses. Only retention required by law (e.g., as per medical record retention rules) is permitted.

### **4. Data During Acquisition or Merger**

If a closing company’s assets (including data) are transferred to another entity during **acquisition or merger**, the data can only be transferred if:
- The **original purpose** of processing remains the same, or  
- Users are **informed and given the option to withdraw consent**.  

Otherwise, the data must be erased before transfer.

---

### **5. Documentation and Proof**

When shutting down, the company should:
1. Create a **data destruction plan** listing all systems, databases, and backups.  
2. Obtain **written confirmations** from third-party processors that data was deleted.  
3. Maintain **proof of compliance** in case the **Data Protection Board of India** requests verification.  
4. Ensure deletion covers **active systems, archives, and backup storage**.

Failure to do so may attract penalties under **Section 33(1)**, up to **₹250 crore**, for violating data retention and deletion obligations.

---

### **6. Key Takeaway**

- Upon shutdown, a company must **delete or anonymize all personal data** unless retention is **legally mandated**.  
- Deletion applies to all systems — local, cloud, and third-party processors.  
- Mergers or acquisitions must ensure continuity of lawful purpose or obtain new consent.  
- Proper documentation and deletion proof are critical to demonstrate **DPDPA compliance**.
