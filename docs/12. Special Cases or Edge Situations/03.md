# Q3 - Does DPDPA cover non-digital data (e.g., paper records)?
:::tip Answer
- DPDPA applies only to digital personal data.  
- Paper records are covered only if they are digitized (scanned, entered into a database, or uploaded).  
:::

:::info Example
If a law firm keeps client details in paper files only, DPDPA does not apply.  
If the same files are later scanned into a digital system, the law applies.
