# Q3 - Does DPDPA cover non-digital data (e.g., paper records)?

:::tip Answer
No — the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* **does not cover purely non-digital or paper-based records**. It applies **only to digital personal data**, or to data that has been **digitized** (converted from physical to electronic form).

In other words, the Act governs **data in electronic form**, or **data that was collected offline but later stored or processed digitally**. Traditional paper records that never enter a digital system are **outside the scope** of DPDPA.

### **1. Legal Definition**

> **Section 3(a)** —  
> The Act applies to the processing of **digital personal data** within India,  
> and to **personal data collected offline but subsequently digitized**.

So:
- **Digital personal data** = any personal data that exists or is processed in digital form.  
- **Offline data that remains on paper** = not covered.  
- **Offline data that is later digitized** (e.g., scanned or entered into a system) = covered.

### **2. Examples of What Is and Isn’t Covered**

| **Type of Data** | **Covered by DPDPA?** | **Explanation** |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| A hospital’s handwritten patient form kept only in a physical file | ❌ No | It is never digitized, so outside DPDPA’s scope. |
| The same form scanned and uploaded into the hospital’s patient management software | ✅ Yes | It becomes “digital personal data.” |
| A school’s student register maintained only on paper | ❌ No | Non-digital data not covered. |
| A school entering student details from that register into its ERP or Excel sheet | ✅ Yes | Once digitized, the data falls under DPDPA. |
| CCTV footage stored on a digital recorder | ✅ Yes | It is digital data, so the Act applies. |

### **3. Why the Act Excludes Purely Offline Data**

The DPDPA is designed specifically for the **digital ecosystem** — websites, apps, databases, and cloud systems — where risks of misuse, breaches, and profiling are higher.  
Offline (paper-based) records are instead governed by:
- **Sectoral regulations** (e.g., hospital record rules, educational guidelines), or  
- **Other general laws** like the **Information Technology Act, 2000**, if later digitized.

This separation prevents overregulation of small entities that maintain only paper-based systems.

:::info Example
An NGO maintaining handwritten lists of beneficiaries for internal recordkeeping does **not** fall under DPDPA. But if the same lists are entered into a digital database for reporting or analytics, the data becomes **subject to DPDPA compliance**.

### **4. Caution for Organizations with Mixed Data Systems**

Many organizations maintain both paper and digital records.  
In such hybrid setups:
- The **digital portions** are regulated under DPDPA.  
- The **paper-only portions** are not — but converting or uploading them later automatically brings them under DPDPA.  
- Hence, organizations should **apply similar privacy standards** across both, even if the law doesn’t mandate it, to avoid inconsistencies or compliance gaps.

---

### **5. Key Takeaway**

- DPDPA applies **only to digital personal data**, or data later **digitized**.  
- Purely offline or paper-based records remain **outside its legal scope**.  
- Once physical data is **entered, scanned, or stored digitally**, all DPDPA provisions — consent, security, breach reporting — **fully apply**.
