# Q5 - What is the maximum penalty for breaches under DPDPA?

:::tip Answer
The penalty depends on the nature of violation:  
- Up to â‚¹250 crore for major failures like not adopting reasonable safeguards or failing to report serious breaches.  
- Lower penalties for less severe failures (e.g., not providing a grievance mechanism).  
:::

:::info Example
- A telecom operator exposing millions of call records without safeguards could face top-end fines.  
- A small retailer delaying response to a handful of access requests may face a much smaller penalty.
