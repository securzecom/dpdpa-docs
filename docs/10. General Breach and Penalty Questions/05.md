# Q5 - What is the maximum penalty for breaches under DPDPA?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* imposes **severe monetary penalties** on organizations (Data Fiduciaries or Data Processors) that fail to protect personal data or violate their obligations under the Act.  

The **maximum penalty for a data breach** — meaning a **breach of security safeguards** resulting in unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss of personal data — is **₹250 crore** per instance of non-compliance.

### **1. Legal Reference**

> **Section 33(1)** —  
> The **Data Protection Board of India** may, after conducting an inquiry, impose monetary penalties specified in the **Schedule** for failure to comply with the provisions of this Act.  

> **Schedule (Entry 2)** —  
> Breach of obligations relating to security safeguards (Section 8(5)) — **Penalty up to ₹250 crore**.

This is the **highest single penalty** allowed under the DPDPA for any category of violation.

### **2. Penalty Framework Overview**

The DPDPA defines different penalty caps depending on the type of violation:

| **Violation** | **Relevant Section** | **Maximum Penalty (₹ Crore)** |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Breach of security safeguards (data breach) | **Section 8(5)** | **250** |
| Failure to notify the Data Protection Board and affected individuals of a breach | **Section 8(5)** read with **Section 33(1)** | **Up to 200** |
| Non-compliance with additional obligations of Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) | **Section 10(2)** | **150** |
| Failure to fulfill obligations regarding children’s data | **Section 9** | **200** |
| Non-fulfillment of general duties by Data Fiduciaries (e.g., correction/erasure) | **Section 12** | **50** |
| Failure to respond to or redress user grievances | **Section 13** | **50** |
| Non-compliance with Board directions or orders | **Section 28(6)** | **10** |

### **3. How the Board Decides the Penalty Amount**

Penalties under the DPDPA are **not automatic or fixed** — the **Data Protection Board of India** determines the final amount based on **Section 33(2)**, which requires consideration of:
- The **nature, gravity, and duration** of the violation.  
- The **type and sensitivity** of personal data involved.  
- Whether the breach was **intentional, negligent, or repeated**.  
- The **actions taken** to mitigate harm and cooperate during investigation.  
- The **likely impact** on affected individuals.

This ensures **proportionate enforcement** — severe penalties for major systemic failures and smaller fines or warnings for minor lapses.

---

### **4. Multiple Breaches and Aggregation**

If a company commits **multiple distinct breaches**, each may be treated separately.  
For example:
- A data leak (**₹250 crore**) + failure to notify users (**₹200 crore**) could theoretically total **₹450 crore** in penalties. The Board may, however, consolidate penalties where violations are interconnected.

---

### **5. Realistic Enforcement Approach**

The DPDPA’s penalty model follows a **risk-based and deterrent approach**, similar to the EU GDPR. While ₹250 crore represents the **maximum limit**, actual penalties will likely depend on:
- The company’s **size and turnover**;  
- **Extent of negligence or intent**;  
- **Remedial measures** taken; and  
- Whether it is a **first-time** or **repeat** offender.

---

:::info Example
A large digital platform suffers a massive breach exposing millions of users’ personal and financial data. Investigation shows poor security controls and failure to notify users for over a week. The **Data Protection Board** finds multiple violations and imposes a **₹200 crore penalty**, citing breach of security safeguards under **Section 8(5)** and delayed reporting.
:::

:::info Example
A small startup suffers a contained internal breach affecting only 50 users, reports it promptly, and demonstrates corrective action. The **Board** may issue a **warning or small penalty**, emphasizing proportional accountability rather than punishment.

### **6. Key Takeaway**

- The **maximum penalty for a data breach** under DPDPA is **₹250 crore**.  
- The **actual penalty depends** on the seriousness, intent, and response to the breach.  
- Prompt reporting, transparency, and strong remediation can **significantly reduce penalties**.
