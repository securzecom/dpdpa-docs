# Q3 - Can individuals get compensation for harm caused by data misuse, or only the government collects penalties?

:::tip Answer 
- Under DPDPA, penalties are payable to the government, not directly to individuals.  
- However, individuals can still seek compensation for damages under other laws, such as the IT Act, Consumer Protection Act, or contract law.  
:::

:::info Example
If Govind’s Aadhaar and PAN are leaked by an insurance company, and someone takes a fraudulent loan in his name:  
- The Data Protection Board may fine the insurer ₹50 crore (payable to the government).  
- Separately, Govind can file a civil case against the insurer for compensation of his financial losses.  
:::

So, penalties ensure enforcement at a national level, while compensation must be separately claimed by the individual.
