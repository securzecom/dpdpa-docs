# Q2 - What happens if a company reports a breach late — is the penalty automatic?

:::tip Answer
No — the penalty for late reporting of a data breach under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* is **not automatic**. However, it is **highly likely** if the **Data Protection Board of India** determines that the delay was **unreasonable, intentional, or negligent**, or if it **increased the risk of harm** to individuals.

The Act gives the Board **discretion** to assess the circumstances of each case before deciding whether to impose a penalty.

### **1. Legal Basis**

> **Section 8(5)** —  
> Every Data Fiduciary shall protect personal data from breach of security safeguards and, **in the event of a breach**, shall notify the **Data Protection Board** and **each affected Data Principal** in such manner as may be prescribed.  

> **Section 33(2)** —  
> In determining the penalty, the Board shall consider the **nature, gravity, and duration of the breach**, the type of personal data involved, whether the breach was **intentional or negligent**, and **whether the Data Fiduciary took prompt action** to mitigate harm.

This means penalties are **based on evaluation**, not imposed automatically.

### **2. How the Board Evaluates Late Reporting**

When a company reports a data breach late, the Board examines:
1. **How long the delay was** after discovering the breach.  
2. **Why** the company failed to report promptly — for example, internal confusion, incomplete investigation, or deliberate suppression.  
3. **Whether the delay caused harm** to Data Principals (such as identity theft, fraud, or loss of trust).  
4. **What steps the company took** to contain or mitigate the impact before reporting.  

If the Board finds the delay **reasonable or justified**, it may issue only a warning or directive.  
But if the delay appears **avoidable or strategic**, a **financial penalty** can follow.

### **3. Penalty Range**

| **Violation Type** | **Relevant Section** | **Maximum Penalty** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Breach of security safeguards (including failure or delay in notification) | Section 8(5) | Up to **₹250 crore** |

The Board decides the final amount based on proportionality and impact.  
For example:
- A small, quickly-contained breach might attract **no fine or a small warning**.  
- A delayed report involving millions of affected users could result in **severe penalties**.

### **4. Practical Example**

:::warning Example
A fintech platform detects a data breach exposing customer transaction records but waits **10 days** to report it, claiming internal verification delays.  
The **Data Protection Board** finds that the company had enough information to report earlier and that the delay **increased the risk of harm** to users.  
It imposes a **₹40 crore penalty** and orders the company to improve its breach detection and reporting processes.
:::

:::info Example
Another company reports a minor data exposure **within 24 hours**, takes remedial steps, and keeps the Board informed of progress.  
Even though the breach affected some users, the **Board waives penalties**, recognizing **good faith and prompt response**.

### **5. Key Takeaway**

- **Late reporting is not automatically penalized**, but it’s closely scrutinized.  
- The **Data Protection Board** evaluates intent, impact, and response quality.  
- Acting **transparently and promptly** can significantly reduce or eliminate penalties.
