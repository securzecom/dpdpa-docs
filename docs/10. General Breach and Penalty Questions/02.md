# Q2 - What happens if a company reports a breach late â€” is the penalty automatic?

:::tip Answer
- Companies must notify the Data Protection Board within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.  
- If the report is delayed, the Board will examine whether there was a reasonable justification.  
- If no valid reason exists, penalties can apply.  
:::

:::info Example
ABC E-commerce discovers on 1st July that its customer database was leaked.  
- If it reports only on 10th July without any valid reason, the Board can impose fines, even if customers did not suffer financial harm.  
- If the company can show that it genuinely detected the breach only on 8th July (e.g., after forensic review), it may escape penalties.
