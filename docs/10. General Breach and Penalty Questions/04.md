# Q4 - Do all breaches need to be reported to affected individuals, or only severe ones?
:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, **all data breaches must be reported** both to the **Data Protection Board of India** and to the **affected Data Principals (individuals)** — there is **no distinction in the law** between “minor” and “severe” breaches.  

However, in practice, the **Central Government** may prescribe **thresholds or exceptions** through rules, allowing organizations to prioritize notifications for breaches that pose a **real risk of harm** to individuals.

### **1. Legal Requirement**

> **Section 8(5)** —  
> Every Data Fiduciary shall protect personal data in its possession from breach of security safeguards.  
> In the event of such a breach, the Data Fiduciary shall **notify the Board and each affected Data Principal** in such manner as may be prescribed.

This provision makes **notification mandatory** to:
1. The **Data Protection Board of India**, and  
2. **Each affected individual**, once a breach occurs.  

The law does **not limit reporting** only to “severe” or “high-impact” cases.

### **2. What May Change Through Future Rules**

While the Act itself requires **universal reporting**, the **Central Government (under Section 40)** may later issue **rules** specifying:
- The **form and timeline** of breach notifications (for example, similar to CERT-In’s 6-hour rule);  
- **Thresholds** for reporting — e.g., breaches that result in actual or likely harm such as identity theft, fraud, or financial loss;  
- **Exceptions** for negligible incidents where data was not exposed or immediately contained.

Until such rules are notified, the **safest interpretation** is to treat **all data breaches as reportable** events.

### **3. Why Broad Reporting Is Required**

The DPDPA aims for **transparency and accountability**.  
Reporting all breaches helps:
- Build user trust;  
- Enable prompt action by the Data Protection Board;  
- Encourage companies to maintain robust security practices.

Failure to notify — even for small breaches — may still attract **penalties up to ₹250 crore** under **Section 33(1)** and the **Schedule (Entry 2)**.

### **4. Practical Approach for Companies**

| **Breach Type** | **Example Scenario** | **Reporting Requirement** |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Serious breach** | Customer database leaked, exposing contact and ID details. | Notify the **Board** and **each affected user** immediately. |
| **Moderate breach** | Employee emails accidentally shared with wrong recipients. | Notify both; document remedial measures. |
| **Minor incident (fully contained)** | Test system logs briefly exposed internally but not accessed externally. | Report to **Board**; user notification may be limited if future rules permit. |

:::info Example
A FinTech app experiences unauthorized access to 500 customers’ transaction details. It promptly reports the incident to the **Data Protection Board** and notifies each affected user, even though no financial loss occurs. This fulfills its duty under **Section 8(5)** and demonstrates good faith compliance.
:::

:::info Example
Another company experiences a similar breach but withholds notice, arguing that “no harm” occurred. The **Data Protection Board** later discovers the omission and imposes a **₹20 crore penalty** for non-disclosure.

### **5. Key Takeaway**

- **All data breaches** must be reported to both the **Board** and **affected individuals**.  
- The **severity of harm** may affect **how** the Board responds, but **not whether** notification is required.  
- Future Government rules may refine the reporting thresholds, but until then, organizations should err on the side of **full disclosure**.
