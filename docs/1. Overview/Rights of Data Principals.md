> **Scope**  
> This page explains each **Right of Data Principals** under the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023** and connects them to the operational mechanisms in the **Draft DPDP Rules (3–22)** and the **Schedules**. It focuses on _how_ these rights should be delivered in real products and processes, including timelines, evidence, vendor propagation, and carve-outs. Sector examples (BFSI, healthcare, consumer apps) are included for clarity.

---

## TL;DR – Core rights at a glance

1. **Right to Access Information** — Obtain a summary of personal data being processed, processing purposes/activities, identities of recipients/processors, and other prescribed details.  
2. **Right to Correction, Completion, Updating & Erasure** — Fix mistakes, complete missing fields, update old records, and erase consent-processed data (subject to legal retention).  
3. **Right to Grievance Redressal** — Complain to the Data Fiduciary/Consent Manager; escalate unresolved issues to the Data Protection Board of India.  
4. **Right to Withdraw Consent** — Withdraw consent with **comparable ease** to giving consent; processing must stop unless another legal basis applies.  
5. **Right to Nominate** — Nominate a person to exercise rights upon death or incapacity.

:::tip Note
Rights are strongest for **consent-based** processing. Where processing is under specific **legitimate uses**, statutory mandates, or state functions, some rights may be limited (with reasons documented and communicated).

## How the Draft Rules (3–22) make rights real

- **Rule 3 (Notice)** mandates discoverable, multilingual notices that include **how to exercise each right**, grievance routes, and Board escalation.
- **Rules on consent/withdrawal** define **comparable ease**, record-keeping, and Consent Manager obligations.
- **Security/TOMs rules** (technical & organizational safeguards) require accuracy, integrity, authentication, logging, vendor controls, and evidence for audits.
- **Breach rule** prescribes rapid notification (e.g., Board within 72h) and user communication.
- **Retention/deletion rules** operationalize erasure and purpose-bound storage.
- **Cross-border rule** restricts conditions for availability/processing abroad.
- **Schedules** provide templates and governance scaffolding (notice content, TOMs, retention classes, breach templates, Board procedures).

:::tip Practitioner takeaway
If you build/operate a product, treat the Draft Rules + Schedules as your **functional requirements** for rights UX, backend workflows, logs, and vendor propagation. If you’re an individual, these create **clear paths** to use your rights and **time-bound** obligations for organizations.

## Right 1 — Access to information about personal data

**What you can request**
- A **summary** of personal data being processed about you.  
- **Processing activities** and **purposes**.  
- **Identities** (or categories) of Data Fiduciaries/Processors with whom data was shared and **what** was shared.  
- Any **other prescribed information** under the Rules/Schedules.

:::info How Rules 3–22 and Schedules enable this
- **Rule 3 (Notice):** Must clearly describe **how to request access** and **expected timelines**.  
- **Security/TOMs:** Ensure the returned information is **accurate, authenticated, and safe** to disclose.  
- **Vendor/processor controls:** Fiduciary must **know** who received data and **what** was sent to answer access queries completely.  
- **Schedules:** Influence the **notice content**, **retention windows**, and **format** of responses.
:::

### Sector examples
:::tip BFSI
A customer asks: “What data did you share with credit bureaus in the last 12 months?”  
The bank produces a summary including **dates**, **data categories** (identifiers, account status, repayment history), **recipient identity**, and **purpose** (credit scoring, underwriting).
:::

:::tip Healthcare
A patient requests a summary of clinical data shared with a diagnostics network.  
The hospital identifies each **processor**, the **tests/records** shared, and **purposes** (diagnosis, billing). If the lab is a processor, its details are included as part of the fiduciary’s disclosure.
:::

:::tip Consumer apps
A user requests all processors used for analytics/ads.  
The app lists **analytics SDKs/ad partners**, **events/identifiers** shared (e.g., device ID, event names), and purposes (analytics, personalization).
:::

### Product/ops checklist (Access)
- **Self-service page**: “Request your data” with identity proofing.  
- **Data map**: System-of-record + processors + categories + purposes.  
- **Evidence**: Timestamped export, handler, and response sent.  
- **Appeal path**: Explain partial/denied responses and grievance route.

---

## Right 2 — Correction, completion, updating & erasure

**Actions you can demand**
- **Correct** inaccuracies; **complete** missing fields; **update** outdated info.  
- **Erase** data processed on the basis of consent (unless retention is mandated by law).

:::info How Rules 3–22 and Schedules enable this
- **Rule 3 (Notice)**: Must explain **how to request correction/erasure** and **where limits apply**.  
- **Retention/Deletion rules**: Purpose-bound retention with **automated deletion triggers** after expiry or withdrawal.  
- **Processor obligations**: Propagate changes/erasure to **downstream processors** via DPA terms and technical hooks.  
- **Grievance escalation**: If refused (e.g., AML/KYC retention), provide **reason + appeal path**.
:::

### Sector examples
:::tip Fintech (BFSI)
User asks to erase marketing profiles and tracking identifiers.  
Company erases profiles across CRM/analytics/ads and notifies partners; retains **KYC/transactions** per AML/tax law; documents **legal basis** and **retention period**.
:::

:::tip Healthcare
Patient corrects a wrong blood group.  
Provider updates the EHR, **notifies labs** and any care partners, and logs the propagation.
:::

:::tip Consumer apps
User updates phone/email.  
App updates auth/notification systems and **syncs** with SMS/email vendors; confirms completion to the user.
:::

### Product/ops checklist (Correction/Erasure)
- Unified **change/erase form** with safe **identity verification**.  
- **Propagation**: Webhooks/API to processors; DPA clauses enforce completion.  
- **Decline templates**: Statutory retention rationale + auto-erase date.  
- **Audit log**: Before/after values (where lawful), handler, timestamps.

:::warning Statutory retention overrides erasure
If law requires keeping data (e.g., AML, taxation, medical record laws), fiduciaries **must** retain it. Provide **partial-grant** with rationale and the **future deletion date**.
:::

## Right 3 — Grievance redressal

You can complain about **failure to honor rights** or other obligations under the Act to the Data Fiduciary/Consent Manager; unresolved issues can be **escalated to the Board**.

:::info How Rules 3–22 and Schedules enable this
- **Notice** must publish **channels** (web, in-app, email) and **service levels**.  
- **Schedules for Board**: Define **intake → hearing → decision** flows.  
- **Record-keeping**: Audit logs for each complaint and each right’s request.
:::

### Product/ops checklist (Grievances)
- Prominent **“File a privacy complaint”** link.  
- **Categorization**: Rights request vs. incident vs. third-party request.  
- **SLA clock** with reminders; **escalation matrix**.  
- **Evidence pack**: All correspondence, decisions, timestamps.

---

## Right 4 — Withdraw consent (comparable ease)

You can **withdraw consent** as easily as it was given. Processing must **stop within a reasonable time** unless another legal basis applies.

:::info How Rules 3–22 and Schedules enable this
- **Rule 3 (Notice)**: Must spell out **comparable ease** withdrawal; no dark patterns.  
- **Consent Manager**: Unified panel to view and withdraw consents across services.  
- **Processor stop-signal**: Propagate withdrawal to partners and purge where required.
:::

### UX pattern & examples
:::tip Comparable ease
If consent was **one-tap** in a settings toggle or during onboarding, withdrawal must be **one-tap in the same area**, not an email form or external ticket.
:::

:::tip BFSI/Healthcare/App
- **Banking app**: “Personalized offers” toggle → Off = withdrawal; CRM/ads updates in minutes.  
- **Hospital portal**: “Research use of de-identified data” opt-in → Off = withdrawal; research registry updated, confirmations recorded.  
- **Social app**: “Ad personalization” toggle → Off; ad SDK configs refreshed and ID syncs removed.
:::

### Product/ops checklist (Withdrawal)
- **In-context toggle** (same surface as opt-in).  
- **Event pipeline** that broadcasts **withdrawal** to all processors.  
- **User confirmation** with effective time and what will stop/change.  
- **Exception handling** if another legal ground applies (explain clearly).

---

## Right 5 — Nominate

You may **nominate** a person to exercise your rights upon your **death or incapacity**.

:::info How Rules 3–22 and Schedules enable this
- **Notice**: Must describe **nomination flow** and acceptable **proofs of authority**.  
- **Grievance**: If nomination is rejected (identity/authority concerns), provide reasons and an appeal path.
:::

### Product/ops checklist (Nomination)
- Simple **nomination form** with eKYC / digital signature.  
- Store nominee linkage with **timestamps** and **verification method**.  
- **Activation conditions**: death/incapacity proof; restricted access scope; logged actions.

## Mapping Rights ↔ Draft Rules 3–22 (Operational View)

| Rule | What it requires (rights-relevant) | Why it matters for rights |
|---|---|---|
| **3. Notice** | Clear, itemized notice in required languages; how to exercise rights; grievance + Board details. | **Discoverability** and **usability** of rights. |
| **4–7. Consent & Withdrawal** | Verifiable consent; **comparable ease** withdrawal; records. | **Control**: give/withdraw quickly without friction. |
| **8–10. Consent Manager** | Registration, obligations, standardized interfaces. | **Centralized control** across services. |
| **11–12. Security (TOMs)** | Authentication, authorization, integrity, logging; processor controls. | Rights responses are **accurate, safe, auditable**. |
| **13. Personal Data Breach** | Notify Board (e.g., within 72h) and affected users per plan. | **Timely awareness** and mitigation for you. |
| **14. Cross-Border Processing** | Conditions/restrictions for making data available abroad. | Keeps rights **enforceable** across borders. |
| **15–16. Retention & Deletion** | Purpose-bound retention classes; deletion triggers. | **Real erasure** after expiry/withdrawal. |
| **17–18. Children & PwDs** | Verifiable guardian consent; special protections; tailored notices. | **Enhanced safeguards** for vulnerable groups. |
| **19–20. Significant Data Fiduciaries** | DPIA, audits, algorithmic transparency, accountability. | Higher-risk entities must do **more** to protect rights. |
| **21–22. State & Board Ops** | State instrumentality carve-outs; Board procedures. | Clarifies **how complaints are handled** nationally. |

:::tip Implementation note
Link each Rule to **internal controls** (policy, SOP, runbook, queue), **technical artifacts** (APIs, webhooks, logs), and **user-facing elements** (notice sections, settings toggles, forms).
:::

## Schedules — Practical impact on your rights

- **Notice Schedule** — Expected content, placement, and language coverage (including Eighth Schedule languages).  
- **TOMs Schedule** — Baseline security controls for rights flows: identity proofing, logging, change controls, vendor propagation, periodic testing.  
- **Retention/Deletion Schedule** — Classes & durations; deletion job requirements; handling of backups and archives.  
- **Breach Schedule** — Templates: what to tell affected users (nature, scope, mitigations, contact).  
- **Board Schedules (x3)** — Complaint intake, hearing, decision/appeal flows and formats.

:::info For readers (Data Principals)
Schedules make sure that when you use your rights, organizations **must** have the **process, security, and documentation** to execute them reliably.
:::

---

## Limits, conflicts, and carve-outs

:::note Read this before relying on a right
- **Statutory retention beats erasure** (e.g., AML/KYC, taxation, medical laws). Organizations must **explain partial denials** and auto-erase after expiry.  
- **Legitimate uses & state functions** may limit certain rights in defined scenarios; reasons must be documented.  
- **Cross-border** transfers may be restricted by government order to retain **redressability** and **oversight**.  
- **Timelines** are prescribed/expected; organizations should publish **SLA ranges** and meet them, keeping evidence for audits/regulator review.
