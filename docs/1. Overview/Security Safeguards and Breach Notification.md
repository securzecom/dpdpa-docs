The **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023** requires every organization, whether small or large, to protect the personal data it collects with strong technical and organizational safeguards. Security is not treated as an afterthought; it is the backbone of compliance. Organizations are expected to anticipate risks, prevent misuse, and respond immediately when things go wrong.

---

- **Mandatory Security Safeguards**  
  Every Data Fiduciary must implement “reasonable security safeguards.” In practice, this includes measures such as **encryption of sensitive data, secure storage systems, access control for employees, regular backups, and activity logs** to monitor who accessed the data. These safeguards should be proportional to the risks involved.  

  :::info Example
  A hospital like ABC Medical Services that stores patient health records must ensure that those records are encrypted and can only be viewed by authorized doctors, not by every hospital staff member.
  :::

- **Breach Detection and Response**  
  If personal data is accidentally exposed, stolen, or misused, the event is considered a personal data breach. The organization must act immediately to investigate the cause, contain the damage, and prepare an official report.

- **Breach Notification to the Board**  
  :::danger Critical Obligation
  Every personal data breach must be reported immediately to the **Data Protection Board of India within seventy-two hours (72)** of discovery. A detailed update, broad facts, events, measures, findings and intimations must be sent to DPBI. The notification must include details of the nature of the breach, the categories of personal data affected, and the remedial measures being taken.
  :::

- **Notification to Individuals**  
  If the breach poses a risk to the rights of Data Principals, the affected individuals must also be informed without delay. This allows them to take protective steps such as changing passwords, monitoring accounts, or blocking suspicious transactions.  

  :::info Example
  If XYZ Bank discovers that customer Aadhaar numbers and linked mobile numbers (e.g., 7890XXXXXXX) were leaked through a compromised server, it must not only inform the Board but also alert its customers, so they can take precautions.
  :::

- **Consequences of Not Reporting**  
  :::danger Critical Point
  Failure to notify a breach can attract severe penalties. In addition to financial fines (up to ₹250 crore depending on severity), the organization may face orders to suspend certain activities or improve its security posture. More importantly, hiding a breach can result in reputational loss that damages customer trust permanently.
  :::

- **Continuous Security Practices**  
  The Act also expects organizations to adopt a culture of ongoing security, not just a one-time effort. This means conducting periodic **vulnerability assessments, updating software patches, training employees against phishing, and maintaining clear internal policies** on handling personal data.

By making breach notification mandatory, the **DPDPA** ensures that individuals are not left in the dark when their data is compromised. It also compels organizations to take security seriously, knowing that their handling of a breach will be subject to scrutiny by regulators and the public alike.
