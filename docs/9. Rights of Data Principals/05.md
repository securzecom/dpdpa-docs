# Q5 - How quickly must companies respond to such requests?

:::tip Answer
- The DPDPA and Draft Rules require companies to respond within the time frame prescribed by the government (expected to be 30 days, though final notification may confirm).  
- Delays or lack of response can attract penalties.

:::info Example
If an e-commerce platform takes 3 months to correct an address error, this delay itself can be treated as non-compliance.
