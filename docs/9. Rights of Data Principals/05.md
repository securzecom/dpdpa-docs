# Q5 - How quickly must companies respond to such requests?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* requires companies (called **Data Fiduciaries**) to respond to all lawful requests made by **Data Principals** — such as requests for **access, correction, erasure, or withdrawal of consent** — **“as soon as may be practicable.”** While the Act does not specify an exact number of days, this phrase establishes a **legal duty of promptness and reasonableness**, meaning companies must act **without undue delay** and in **good faith**.

### **1. Legal Reference**

> **Section 12(2)** —  
> The Data Fiduciary shall, on receipt of a request from the Data Principal, **correct, complete, update or erase personal data as soon as may be practicable**, unless retention is necessary for compliance with any law.  

> **Section 13(2)** —  
> The Data Fiduciary shall establish an **effective grievance redressal mechanism**, and must respond to a Data Principal’s grievance **within such period as may be prescribed by the rules** (to be notified by the Central Government).

### **2. Expected Time Frame (Practical Interpretation)**

Since the exact period will be **prescribed in upcoming rules**, most experts and policy drafts interpret **“as soon as practicable”** to mean:

| **Request Type** | **Recommended Response Window (Best Practice)** |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Correction, updating, or erasure of data | Within **7–15 working days** |
| Withdrawal of consent | **Immediate** or within **72 hours** |
| Access to data or data-sharing summary | Within **7–15 working days** |
| Grievance acknowledgment | Within **24–48 hours** |
| Full grievance resolution | Within **30 days** (or sooner, once prescribed) |

These timelines are aligned with industry standards and reflect the intent of **Section 13(2)** to ensure timely grievance handling.

### **3. Escalation If the Company Fails to Respond**

If a company delays or ignores a request:
1. The Data Principal may file a **complaint with the company’s Grievance Officer**.  
2. If no satisfactory action occurs within the prescribed time, the Data Principal may **escalate the matter to the Data Protection Board of India** under **Section 28(1)**.  
3. The Board can then **inquire**, **issue directions**, or **impose penalties** for non-compliance.

### **4. Penalties for Delayed or Ignored Requests**

Under **Section 33(1)** and the **Schedule**, failure to respond to Data Principal requests (for access, correction, or erasure) may attract a penalty of up to **₹50 crore**, depending on the gravity, duration, and intent of the violation.

:::info Example
A social-media company receives a user’s request to delete their account data. The company neither responds nor acts for over a month. The user raises a grievance and later files a complaint with the **Data Protection Board**. After inquiry, the Board finds the delay unjustified and imposes a penalty of **₹15 crore** for violation of **Section 12(2)** and **Section 13(2)**.

### **5. Key Takeaway**

Companies must:
- **Acknowledge and act** on requests quickly.  
- **Document response times** for accountability.  
- **Resolve grievances promptly**, as delays may be treated as non-compliance.  

Acting “as soon as may be practicable” effectively means responding **without unreasonable delay** — demonstrating both procedural fairness and technical readiness.
