# Q2 - Can a person request all their data be “ported” (moved) to another company like GDPR allows?

:::tip Answer
No — the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* does **not include a right to data portability**, unlike the European Union’s **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.  
:::

The DPDPA provides rights such as:
- **Right to access** one’s data (Section 11);  
- **Right to correction and erasure** (Section 12);  
- **Right to grievance redressal** (Section 13);  
- **Right to nominate** another person in case of death or incapacity (Section 14)

However, it **does not include any provision** allowing a Data Principal to request their data be *transferred or “ported”* from one company to another.

### **1. Scope of the Access Right**
Under **Section 11**, a Data Principal can request:
- A **summary of their personal data** being processed;  
- Details of **processing activities** and **entities with whom data is shared**; and  
- Other related information as prescribed by the Government.  

This right is **limited to information disclosure** — it does not allow individuals to download, transfer, or reuse their data elsewhere.

### **2. Comparison with GDPR**

| **Aspect** | **GDPR (Article 20)** | **DPDPA (2023)** |
|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Right to data portability | Yes — individuals can request a copy of their data in a machine-readable format and transfer it to another controller. | No such right; only access, correction, and erasure are allowed. |
| Purpose | To empower individuals and foster competition and interoperability between services. | Focused mainly on lawful processing, consent, and accountability. |
| Transferability | Explicitly allowed between service providers. | Not mentioned; sharing occurs only under lawful processing or consent. |

---

### **3. Practical Effect**

This means:
- Individuals in India **cannot request** their personal data to be directly moved from one company (like a bank or social media platform) to another.  
- Organizations are not required to create **machine-readable data export tools** or APIs for portability.  
- Any data transfer must still follow **lawful processing and consent** mechanisms under Sections 6–8.

:::info Example
A user under GDPR can ask a streaming service to transfer their listening history directly to another platform.  
Under DPDPA, the same user in India can **request access to their data summary**, but cannot demand the data be **ported** or **transferred** to another service.

### **4. Possible Future Inclusion**

While the DPDPA omits this right for now, the **Central Government** may introduce data portability in future rules or amendments — especially if interoperability between services becomes a policy priority under India’s digital economy framework.

**Referenced Provisions:**  
- **Section 11** – Right to access information about personal data.  
- **Section 12** – Right to correction and erasure.  
- **Section 13** – Grievance redressal mechanism.  
- **Section 14** – Right to nominate another person.  
- *No clause exists providing a right to data portability under the DPDPA 2023.*
