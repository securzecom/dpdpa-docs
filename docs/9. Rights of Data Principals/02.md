# Q2 - Can a person request all their data be “ported” (moved) to another company like GDPR allows?

:::tip Answer
- Unlike the EU’s GDPR, the DPDPA does not include a “Right to Data Portability.”  
- Individuals have rights to access, correction, erasure, and withdrawal of consent, but cannot demand that their data be transferred directly to another service provider.  
:::
:::info Example
If Govind wants his trading history on ABC Stock Brokers to be sent directly to XYZ Stock Brokers, the DPDPA does not obligate ABC to do this.  
He may still request a copy of his data and manually provide it to another service, but there is no legal mandate for direct “porting.”
