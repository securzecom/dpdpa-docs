# Q4 - What if a company refuses a Data Principal’s request citing “legal necessity”?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, a company (Data Fiduciary) must normally correct, update, or erase personal data upon a valid request from a **Data Principal**. However, it may **lawfully refuse** such a request if the continued retention or processing of that data is **necessary to comply with any law in force** — a concept referred to as *“legal necessity.”*

### **1. Legal Basis for Refusal**

> **Section 12(3)** —  
> A Data Principal may request erasure of her personal data, and the Data Fiduciary shall erase such data **unless retention is necessary for the specified purpose or for compliance with any law** for the time being in force.

Similarly,  
> **Section 8(7)** —  
> A Data Fiduciary shall erase personal data once the purpose is no longer served **unless retention is necessary for compliance with any law** for the time being in force.

This means that a company can retain or refuse to erase data if it is legally required to keep it — for example, by financial-regulatory, taxation, employment, or audit-retention laws.

### **2. What Counts as “Legal Necessity”?**

Typical cases include:
- **Banking and KYC records:** Banks must retain customer identification and transaction data for at least ten years after account closure under RBI and anti-money-laundering rules.  
- **Tax documentation:** Businesses must preserve invoices and accounting records for prescribed periods under income-tax and GST laws.  
- **Employment records:** Employers may need to retain payroll or compliance data to defend legal claims or meet labour-law requirements.  

If a company relies on “legal necessity,” it must ensure the **retention directly relates to a specific legal obligation**, not a general business preference.

---

### **3. Company’s Duty to Communicate**

Even when refusal is justified, the Data Fiduciary must:
- **Inform the Data Principal** clearly that erasure or correction cannot be performed because of a legal requirement.  
- **Specify the law or regulation** under which data retention is required.  
- **Erase the data** once the legal obligation ends.

Failure to communicate transparently can be treated as non-compliance with **Sections 8 and 12**, leading to possible investigation by the **Data Protection Board of India**.

### **4. Example**

:::info Example
A customer closes her bank account and requests deletion of her personal data.  
The bank refuses, citing its obligation under banking regulations to **retain identity and transaction records for ten years** after closure.  
This refusal is lawful under **Sections 8(7)** and **12(3)** because the retention is required for legal compliance.  
Once the ten-year period ends, the bank must erase or anonymise the data.

### **5. Remedies for the Data Principal**

If a Data Principal believes the refusal is **unjustified or misused**:
1. They may file a complaint with the company’s **Grievance Officer** (Section 13).  
2. If unresolved, they may **escalate the issue to the Data Protection Board** (Sections 27–28).  
3. The Board can **order compliance** or **impose penalties** if the company’s invocation of “legal necessity” is found improper.

---

### **Summary**

A company can deny a correction or erasure request **only when legally bound to retain** the data.  
It must explain the legal basis, act proportionately, and delete the data once the obligation expires.  
Misuse of this exemption may invite inquiry and penalties up to **₹50 crore** under **Section 33 & Schedule Entry 7**.
