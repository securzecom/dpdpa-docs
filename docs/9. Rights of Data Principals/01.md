# Q1 - What happens if a company ignores a Data Principal’s request for erasure or correction?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, every **Data Principal** (the individual whose data is being processed) has a **legal right** to request correction, completion, updating, or erasure of their personal data. If a company — also known as a **Data Fiduciary** — **ignores, delays, or refuses** such a request without valid justification, it is considered a **breach of its statutory obligation** under **Section 12** and may face **investigation and monetary penalties** imposed by the **Data Protection Board of India**.

### **1. The Right of Correction and Erasure**

> **Section 12(1)** —  
> A Data Principal shall have the right to correction, completion, updating, and erasure of her personal data for which she has previously given consent.  

> **Section 12(2)** —  
> The Data Fiduciary shall, **on receipt of such a request**, correct, complete, update, or erase the personal data **as soon as may be practicable**, unless retention is necessary for compliance with law or lawful purpose.

This means the company **cannot simply ignore** such a request.  
It must either:
- Act on the request and confirm completion, or  
- Provide a **reasonable legal justification** (for example, data retention required by tax or banking laws).

### **2. Escalation and Complaint Path**

If the company fails to respond:
1. The Data Principal may file a complaint with the **Grievance Officer** designated by the company under **Section 13(1)**.  
2. If the issue remains unresolved, the Data Principal can **escalate the complaint** to the **Data Protection Board of India** under **Section 28(1)**.  
3. The Board may initiate an **inquiry** under **Section 27**, summoning records and explanations from the company.

### **3. Possible Consequences and Penalties**

If the Board finds that the company **failed to act** on the Data Principal’s request or **violated its obligations** under Section 12, it can impose penalties under **Section 33(1)** read with the **Schedule**.

| **Violation** | **Relevant Section** | **Maximum Penalty** |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Failure to fulfill obligations regarding correction/erasure | Section 12 | Up to **₹50 crore** |

In addition to monetary penalties, the Board may:
- Direct the company to **immediately correct or erase** the data.  
- Issue a **compliance order** or warning.  
- Consider repeated non-compliance as an **aggravating factor** in future inquiries.

---

### **4. Legitimate Exceptions**

The company may legally refuse or delay erasure if:
- The data must be retained to comply with another law (e.g., income-tax records, KYC data).  
- The request conflicts with public interest, law enforcement, or legal obligations.  

However, even in such cases, the company must **communicate the reason for refusal** transparently to the Data Principal.

:::info Example
A fitness-tracking start-up continues to store a user’s health data even after the user requests deletion. The user files a complaint to the company’s grievance officer but receives no response for 30 days. She then escalates the case to the **Data Protection Board**, which orders the company to delete the data and imposes a **₹25-crore penalty** for failing to act on the erasure request and violating Section 12.

### **5. Summary**

Ignoring a Data Principal’s request for correction or erasure:
- Violates **Section 12** of the DPDPA.  
- Can trigger **Board inquiry** under **Sections 27–28**.  
- May result in **fines up to ₹50 crore**.  
- Damages trust and exposes the company to reputational risk.
