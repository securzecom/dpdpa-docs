One of the most innovative features of the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023** is the introduction of **Consent Managers**. These are independent, registered entities whose sole purpose is to help individuals exercise control over their personal data. Unlike traditional systems where each company manages consent separately, Consent Managers act as a neutral platform that allows people to view, grant, and withdraw consent across multiple services in one place.

- **Independent and Neutral Function**  
  A Consent Manager must operate as an independent entity registered with the **Data Protection Board of India**. It cannot favor any one organization and must serve only the interests of the individual, also known as the Data Principal. This independence ensures trust and fairness.

- **Managing Consent Across Platforms**  
  Instead of users having to visit every website or app separately to update permissions, a Consent Manager provides a single interface where all consents can be tracked and modified.  

  :::info Example
  A person who has given consent to a bank, an e-commerce platform, and a streaming service can log into their Consent Manager account and withdraw or modify all these permissions in one place.
  :::

- **Ensuring Transparency and Simplicity**  
  Consent Managers are required to make the process of granting or withdrawing consent simple, accessible, and transparent. They must display the purpose of data collection, the type of data requested, and the organization seeking it in plain language, free from technical jargon.

- **Accountability and Record-Keeping**  
  A Consent Manager must maintain accurate records of when consent was given, for what purpose, and when it was withdrawn. These records can serve as proof in case of disputes or investigations.  

  :::critical Critical Point
  Record-keeping is legally important because it provides evidence in regulatory investigations or disputes between individuals and organizations.
  :::

- **Secure Handling of Requests**  
  Since Consent Managers deal with sensitive information, they must implement strong security safeguards such as **encryption, access controls, and activity logs**. They must ensure that consent requests are genuine and not manipulated.  

  :::danger Critical Point
  Weak security at a Consent Manager could compromise multiple organizations and millions of users at once, making safeguards non-negotiable.
  :::

- **Empowering Individuals**  
  The purpose of introducing Consent Managers is to make individuals active participants in the data economy rather than passive subjects. By giving people a single, trusted interface, the law ensures that consent is meaningful, informed, and easy to manage.

The concept of Consent Managers is particularly important in a country like India, where millions of new internet users are coming online every year, many of them for the first time. By simplifying the complex process of consent, **DPDPA ensures that digital inclusion is matched with digital empowerment**.
