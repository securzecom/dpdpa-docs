# Q5 - How does a Consent Manager ensure that a withdrawal of consent is reflected immediately across all organizations using that consent?

Consent Managers act as **real-time intermediaries**:  

- When a Data Principal withdraws consent, the Consent Manager must immediately notify the concerned Data Fiduciary through secure APIs or digital infrastructure.  
- The Data Fiduciary must then stop processing the personal data for the withdrawn purpose.  

:::info Example
If Krishna withdraws his consent through ABC Consent Manager to receive promotional offers from XYZ E-commerce, the Consent Manager instantly updates XYZâ€™s systems. From that moment, XYZ must stop sending promotional emails or SMS to Krishna.
