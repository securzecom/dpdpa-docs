# Q2 - How do Consent Managers earn revenue if their role must remain neutral?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, a **Consent Manager** acts as a **neutral intermediary** between individuals (Data Principals) and Data Fiduciaries. Its core responsibility is to **facilitate, record, and manage consent** in a transparent and interoperable manner — not to influence or monetise personal data directly.

Although Consent Managers must remain neutral and accountable to the Data Principal (**Section 6(8)**), they can still generate revenue **through regulated, service-based business models** that do not compromise neutrality, privacy, or independence.

### **1. Permitted Revenue Models**

**a. Subscription or Service Fees (B2B Model)**  
Consent Managers may charge **Data Fiduciaries** (e.g., companies, platforms, or service providers) for providing secure and standardised consent management APIs or dashboards.  
- These fees typically cover system integration, API maintenance, consent-log storage, and verification services.  
- Pricing models may include per-API-call costs, annual platform subscriptions, or enterprise licensing.

**b. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Model**  
They can operate as **regulated technology platforms** offering consent orchestration tools or compliance infrastructure.  
Fiduciaries integrate these systems to simplify user consent collection and withdrawal, and pay for usage.

**c. Certification and Compliance Services**  
Consent Managers may offer optional tools that help Data Fiduciaries verify compliance with the DPDPA (e.g., consent dashboards, analytics, or record-keeping automation).  
These are ancillary services provided within the framework of neutrality.

**d. Government or Industry Funding**  
Since Consent Managers play a public-interest role in protecting data rights, they may receive:  
- **Government grants or incentives** for promoting digital trust ecosystems; or  
- **Industry consortium support** for maintaining open interoperability standards (similar to India’s Account Aggregator framework).

### **2. Activities They Cannot Monetise**

- Consent Managers **cannot sell, trade, or use personal data** for marketing or profiling.  
- They **cannot prioritise or discriminate** between Data Fiduciaries based on commercial relationships.  
- They must ensure **full transparency** about their fee structures and maintain **equal access** for all registered Fiduciaries and Data Principals.

Violations of neutrality or misuse of personal data can result in **investigation and penalties** by the **Data Protection Board of India** under **Section 27(1)(c)** and **Section 33(1)**.

:::info Example
A Consent Manager provides a secure consent-management API to multiple e-commerce and fintech platforms.  
Each platform pays an annual subscription fee for integration and API maintenance.  
The Consent Manager does **not access or monetise** customer data — it only facilitates consent exchange and maintains audit logs in compliance with the DPDPA.
