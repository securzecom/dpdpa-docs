# Q2 - How do Consent Managers earn revenue if their role must remain neutral?

Consent Managers cannot charge individuals for basic use of their services (like withdrawing consent). Their revenue typically comes from:  

- Charging Data Fiduciaries (banks, insurers, e-commerce platforms) for using their consent infrastructure.  
- Offering value-added services, such as analytics on aggregated, anonymized consent patterns, but only within the limits of the law.  
- Receiving government support or incentives, especially in the early stages, to build trust in the ecosystem.  

:::info Example
A Consent Manager used by multiple insurance companies may charge each insurer a small fee per consent transaction (e.g., ₹0.50–₹1). This allows it to stay independent without burdening individuals.
