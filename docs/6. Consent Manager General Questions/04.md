# Q4 - Can a foreign company be registered as a Consent Manager in India?

Yes, but only if it complies with Indian requirements:  

- It must establish a legal presence in India (a registered subsidiary or office).  
- It must demonstrate that its systems meet Indian security, transparency, and neutrality standards.  
- It must remain accountable to the Data Protection Board of India.

A global fintech infrastructure provider based in Singapore may apply to operate as a Consent Manager in India, but it will need to set up ABC Consent India Pvt. Ltd. as a subsidiary and comply with all Indian rules before registration.
