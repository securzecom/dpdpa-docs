# Q4 - Can a foreign company be registered as a Consent Manager in India?

:::tip Answer
A **foreign company can be registered as a Consent Manager in India** only if it **meets the registration, localisation, and compliance requirements** prescribed under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* and related rules issued by the **Central Government**.

The Act itself does **not prohibit foreign entities** from becoming Consent Managers. However, under **Section 6(9)** and **Section 40(2)(c)–(d)**, the Central Government may prescribe **technical, operational, financial, and jurisdictional conditions** for registration with the **Data Protection Board of India**. These conditions will effectively determine whether and how a foreign company can qualify.

### **1. Registration and Jurisdiction Requirements**

To operate as a Consent Manager in India, a foreign company would likely be required to:
- **Establish a legal presence in India**, such as a registered subsidiary, liaison office, or branch under Indian law.  
- **Comply with Indian jurisdiction**, meaning it must be subject to Indian courts and the **Data Protection Board of India** for enforcement and penalties.  
- **Maintain data infrastructure and consent records** within India or in a government-approved jurisdiction that meets prescribed adequacy or localisation standards.  
- **Meet technical and security benchmarks** defined by the Central Government (for interoperability, encryption, and auditability).  

Without meeting these conditions, a foreign company **cannot act as a valid Consent Manager** under the DPDPA.

### **2. Role of the Data Protection Board and Central Government**

- The **Central Government** sets the **eligibility criteria** and operational standards for Consent Managers.  
- The **Data Protection Board** maintains the **registry** and ensures compliance.  
Both authorities must approve the registration before a company can begin operations.

### **3. Practical Implication**

In practice, a global technology company wanting to operate as a Consent Manager in India would need to:
1. Incorporate or register a local entity under the **Companies Act, 2013**.  
2. Apply to the **Data Protection Board** for registration as a Consent Manager.  
3. Demonstrate compliance with technical, financial, and jurisdictional requirements as notified by the Central Government.

:::info Example
A technology company based in Singapore wishes to provide consent-management services for Indian fintech platforms. To operate legally, it registers a subsidiary in India, hosts consent data within Indian servers, and applies for registration with the **Data Protection Board of India**. Only after approval can it function as a recognised Consent Manager under the DPDPA.
