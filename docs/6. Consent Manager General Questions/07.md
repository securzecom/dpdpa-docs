# Q7 - How does DPDPA ensure neutrality of Consent Managers so they do not secretly favor large corporations?

:::tip Answer
The *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)* has built-in legal and technical safeguards to ensure that **Consent Managers remain neutral, transparent, and fair** in their operations. They are **not allowed to discriminate** between Data Fiduciaries (organizations) or Data Principals (individuals) and cannot secretly favor large corporations or business partners.

### **1. Legal Accountability Under Section 6(8)**

Under **Section 6(8)**, every Consent Manager must:
- **Act on behalf of the Data Principal** and in their best interest.  
- Be **accountable to the Data Principal**, not to the Data Fiduciary.  
- Operate in a **transparent, accessible, and interoperable manner**, following technical standards prescribed by the **Central Government**.

This means a Consent Manager cannot:
- Prioritize or delay requests from certain companies.  
- Charge different fees that give preferential access.  
- Manipulate or hide consent options to benefit any particular organization.

Any deviation from neutrality constitutes a **breach of statutory duty** and can lead to penalties or cancellation of registration.

### **2. Government-Defined Registration and Compliance Standards**

Under **Section 6(9)** read with **Section 40(2)(c)–(d)**:
- The **Central Government** defines the conditions, eligibility criteria, and technical standards for Consent Managers to operate.  
- These conditions may include mandatory **audits, code of conduct, and transparency disclosures** to prove neutrality.  
- Only Consent Managers meeting these standards can be **registered with the Data Protection Board of India**.  
- Their license or registration can be **suspended or revoked** if they act in a biased or non-transparent manner.

### **3. Oversight by the Data Protection Board of India**

The **Data Protection Board** acts as the enforcement authority.  
Under **Section 27(1)(c)**, the Board may:
- Inquire into complaints or breaches by a Consent Manager.  
- Examine consent logs and communication records to detect bias or manipulation.  
- Impose penalties or direct suspension of the Consent Manager under **Section 33(1)**.  

This ensures operational neutrality through **regulatory oversight and auditability**.

---

### **4. Interoperability and Transparency Requirements**

All Consent Managers are required to use **common technical and data-sharing standards**.  
Because of interoperability:
- Each Consent Manager must use the same API structure, consent format, and communication protocol.  
- This prevents any single Consent Manager from building exclusive integrations with large corporations or offering faster access to them.  
- Transparency logs and audit trails allow both the **Board** and **Data Principals** to verify that all consents are processed equally.

---

### **5. Penalties for Breach of Neutrality**

If a Consent Manager is found to have:
- Favored certain Data Fiduciaries,  
- Manipulated consent options, or  
- Obstructed withdrawals for commercial gain,  

the **Data Protection Board** may impose monetary penalties under **Section 33(1)**, and the **Central Government** may revoke its registration under the rules made using **Section 40(2)**.

---

:::info Example
A Consent Manager integrates faster API updates for large e-commerce platforms but delays consent withdrawals for smaller startups.  
Upon receiving complaints, the **Data Protection Board** audits its systems, finds evidence of bias, and suspends its registration for breaching neutrality and transparency obligations under **Section 6(8)**.
