# Q1 - Who oversees Consent Managers - is it only the Data Protection Board, or also the government?

:::tip Answer
Consent Managers are regulated and overseen by **both** the **Central Government** and the **Data Protection Board of India**, but in different ways and at different stages of their operation.

### **1. Role of the Central Government**

The **Central Government** is responsible for:
- **Registration and approval** of Consent Managers.  
  - Under **Section 6(9)**, every Consent Manager must be **registered with the Data Protection Board** in such manner and subject to such *technical, operational, financial,* and *other conditions* as may be **prescribed by the Central Government** through rules.  
  - The power to make these rules is granted under **Section 40(2)(c) and (d)**.  
- **Issuing standards and conditions** for their functioning.  
  - These include defining interoperability, transparency, and security standards that Consent Managers must follow when handling user consent data.  
- **Overall policy and regulatory oversight** of the framework for Consent Managers — ensuring they operate within the boundaries of national data-governance policy.

In summary, the Government sets the **rules of operation** for Consent Managers and determines **who is eligible** to be registered.

### **2. Role of the Data Protection Board of India**

The **Data Protection Board** oversees **day-to-day compliance and enforcement**.  
Its responsibilities include:
- **Registration administration** – recording and maintaining the list of registered Consent Managers.  
- **Inquiry and enforcement** – under **Section 27(1)(c)**, the Board may inquire into any breach by a Consent Manager relating to its obligations toward Data Principals.  
- **Penalties and corrective actions** – the Board may impose fines, suspend registration, or issue directions under **Section 33(1)** if a Consent Manager fails to meet its legal or operational duties.

Thus, while the Central Government defines the policy and standards, the **Board acts as the enforcement authority**, ensuring ongoing compliance.

:::info Example
A registered Consent Manager fails to provide accurate consent logs during a complaint inquiry. The **Data Protection Board** investigates the issue, finds non-compliance with technical standards prescribed by the Government, and imposes a penalty while recommending suspension until the Consent Manager updates its systems.
