# Q1 - Who oversees Consent Managers - is it only the Data Protection Board, or also the government?

Consent Managers are registered and regulated by the **Data Protection Board of India**. The Board checks whether they meet technical, financial, and organizational requirements before granting registration (Schedule I).  

The **Central Government**, through the Rules, sets the overall framework, but day-to-day oversight — audits, inspections, and inquiries — lies with the Board.  

:::info Example
If ABC Consent Services Pvt. Ltd. is registered as a Consent Manager and a complaint arises that it is favoring certain banks in displaying consent options, the Data Protection Board can investigate, audit, and if needed, suspend its registration.
