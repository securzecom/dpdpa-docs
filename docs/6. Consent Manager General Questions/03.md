# Q3 - What happens if a Consent Manager itself suffers a data breach - who is liable, the Consent Manager or the Fiduciary relying on it?

:::tip Answer
If a **Consent Manager** experiences a data breach, the **Consent Manager itself is primarily liable** for that incident — not the Data Fiduciary — because it is an **independent entity** registered under **Section 6(9)** of the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*.  

However, both the Consent Manager and any Data Fiduciaries that rely on it have **distinct responsibilities** that may be examined by the **Data Protection Board of India** to determine shared or separate liability.

### **1. Primary Liability of the Consent Manager**

A Consent Manager is directly responsible for:
- Implementing **security safeguards** to prevent data breaches (**Section 8(5)** read with **Section 6(8)**).  
- **Protecting consent records** and other personal data in its custody.  
- **Notifying** the **Data Protection Board** and affected **Data Principals** of the breach under **Section 8(6)**.  
- Ensuring its systems meet all **technical and organisational standards** prescribed by the Central Government (**Section 6(9)**).  

If the breach arises from poor security, technical failure, or negligence by the Consent Manager, the **Board may impose penalties** under **Section 33(1)** and may also suspend or revoke its registration.

### **2. Role and Exposure of the Data Fiduciary**

The Data Fiduciary is **not automatically liable** for a breach suffered by an independent Consent Manager.  
However, the Board may evaluate whether the Fiduciary:
- Exercised **due diligence** in selecting a registered and compliant Consent Manager.  
- Had appropriate **contractual safeguards** in place for handling consent data.  
- Responded responsibly once the breach became known (e.g., by informing affected users and coordinating remediation).

If the Fiduciary ignored these responsibilities or continued using an unregistered or non-compliant Consent Manager, **joint liability** may be considered.

### **3. Investigation and Enforcement**

When such a breach occurs:
1. The **Consent Manager** must report it immediately to the **Data Protection Board** and the affected individuals.  
2. The **Board** conducts an inquiry under **Sections 27–28** to determine the cause, scope, and responsible parties.  
3. The **Board** may impose penalties or issue corrective directions to either or both entities based on their level of fault.

:::info Example
A registered Consent Manager suffers a system hack that exposes user consent records and identifiers. The **Consent Manager** failed to patch its servers despite prior warnings — the **Data Protection Board** imposes a penalty for inadequate safeguards and non-notification. The **Data Fiduciary** using the platform had valid contracts and acted promptly after the breach, so it is **not penalised**.
