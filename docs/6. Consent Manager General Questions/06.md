# Q6 - Can a Data Principal sue a Consent Manager directly if it mishandles their consents?

:::tip Answer
Under the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA)*, a **Data Principal** cannot directly "sue" a Consent Manager in court in the first instance. 

Instead, the Data Principal must seek redress through the **Data Protection Board of India**, which is the primary authority empowered to **investigate and penalise** Consent Managers for any violation of their legal duties.

### **1. Statutory Redress Mechanism (Section 27–28)**

If a Consent Manager mishandles a Data Principal’s consent — for example, by:
- Failing to record consent correctly,  
- Ignoring a withdrawal request, or  
- Allowing unauthorised access to consent data,  

the Data Principal can **file a complaint** or **raise a grievance** with the **Data Protection Board of India** under **Section 27(1)(c)**.  
The Board then:
1. Conducts an inquiry into the alleged breach.  
2. Hears both the Consent Manager and the complainant.  
3. Issues directions or imposes penalties under **Section 33(1)**.

This makes the **Board** the first and primary enforcement channel — not the civil courts.

### **2. Escalation to Appellate Tribunal (Section 29)**

If the Data Principal (or the Consent Manager) is dissatisfied with the Board’s decision, they may **appeal** to the **Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)** under **Section 29(1)**.  
This provides a higher forum for review without approaching a regular civil court.

### **3. Civil or Judicial Action (Exceptional Circumstances)**

While the DPDPA primarily establishes an administrative redressal process, a Data Principal may approach **civil courts or consumer forums** only in **exceptional cases**, such as:
- Contractual disputes outside the DPDPA framework (e.g., if the Consent Manager breached specific terms of service).  
- Situations where damages or compensation are sought under other applicable laws (e.g., *Information Technology Act, 2000* or *Consumer Protection Act, 2019*).

However, for data-protection-related violations, the **Data Protection Board remains the central adjudicating body**.

:::info Example
A Consent Manager fails to record a Data Principal’s withdrawal of consent, causing continued use of personal data by several companies.  
The individual files a complaint with the **Data Protection Board**, which investigates, verifies consent logs, and imposes a penalty on the Consent Manager for negligence.  
If the individual is not satisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the **TDSAT** — not directly to a civil court.
